**Description:**

> Damn it, that stupid smart cat litter is broken again

>
> I know my contract number is stored somewhere on that interface but I can't find it and this is the only available page! Please have a look and get this info for me !
>
> FYI No need to bruteforce anything there. If you do you'll be banned permanently
