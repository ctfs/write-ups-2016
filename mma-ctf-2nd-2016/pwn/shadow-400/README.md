## Write-up

using negative values in message length provide us buffer overflow. due to task approach on protecting ret addrs,
we can use
tls_dtors_list to achieve code execution and run system("/bin/sh");

cookie is our problem so we need leaking it.

leaking libc addr can be done by overwriting message function args (break 0x0804890f)

for overwriting tls_dtors i need +1 step, this can be achieved by overwriting max steps(3) on stack with (0x4)

finally we overwrite tls_dtor with address of [system_addr, bin_sh_addr] which i used tls_dtor+0x10, stack addr cannot be used to reliable exploitation
