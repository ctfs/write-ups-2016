**Description:**

> Cyber offense specialists working for the German government have implemented this new version of the Bundestrojaner. Unfortunately the federal police lost access to this cyber backdoor and cybercrimals took over. This is the greatest threat to national security ever since. Regain control over it as soon as possible!
