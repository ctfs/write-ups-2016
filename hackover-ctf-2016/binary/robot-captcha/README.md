**Description:**

> The world is at a turning point. With new cyber technologies almost all humans are cyborgs now. Most cyborgs are already at version 3.5, but some are still running 2.7. Nevertheless, there are dangerous fundamentalists called "Human Life 0.1 Restoration Movement" who want to reverse all cyber progress made so far. They hate humans with cyborg functionalities and try to kill them all. To identify those criminals we implemented a robocaptcha, which only cyborgs and robots can solve. Let's eliminate those conservative idiots!
