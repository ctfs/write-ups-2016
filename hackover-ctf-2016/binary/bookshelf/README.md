**Description:**

> Our business market analysis told us that the cyber kids of today don't read books anymore. Cyber parents are desperate about their cyber kid's education. Therefore we released a new cyber ebook reader which sends cyber waves directly to the kids brains to make them read electronically. Currently we are in negotiations with many copyright owners to provide a larger library. For now you can read the work by H.P. Lovecraft, which is public cyber domain.
