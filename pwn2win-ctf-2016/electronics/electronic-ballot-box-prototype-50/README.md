# Pwn2Win CTF : electronic-ballot-box-prototype-50

**Category:** Electronics
**Points:** 50
**Solves:**
**Description:**
A member of Project SKY has infiltrated into a Club recycling facility and got access to one of the first prototypes of what became, afterwards, an electronic ballot box (yes, all of this has been born because of the influence of the Club). We know that the prototype has the potential to unveil the true inner workings behind electronic voting, but we need your help. Add CTF-BR{} around the flag before submitting it.
