# Pwn2Win CTF : secret-accounts-80

**Category:** Pwn
**Points:** 80
**Solves:**
**Description:**
Through many months of sniffing, we discovered a server running a software which the Club uses to manage information about secret bank accounts abroad. We even obtained its source code. We need to obtain access to the system in order to discover the real name of the owner of the account possessing the greater amount of money, in which bank it is, and the real amount. As you might expect, it seems that the Club has hunkered down to assert only authorized people, which really know what they are doing, are able to operate this system and to interpret information provided by it. Rumors exist that the Mentor himself manages it, as amazing as it may seem (he is old but not deciduous!).

You will need good “python-fu” to win this challenge!

Submit the flag in the following format: CTF-BR{info1_info2_info3}.

Hint: Who is Fideleeto (Cuba!) in real life? Take this into account. :)
