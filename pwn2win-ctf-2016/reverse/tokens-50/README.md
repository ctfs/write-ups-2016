# Pwn2Win CTF : tokens-50

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 50
**Solves:**
**Description:**
We discovered a Club’s “homemade” token generator system which uses a fixed value as a seed (is it a joke?). Some Club systems use this token scheme, so we need to make a leak in order to compromise them. Due to a week-long effort, our hardcore newbie SkyMex was able to obtain the token generator source code from a private git repository before it received the official seed.

Submit the flag in the format: CTF-BR{seed}.
