**Description:**

> Traffic Dots are devices used in roadways around the world for detecting car presence at intersections as well as highways. They communicate with the traffic light controller over an unprotected 2.4ghz connection. They report how many cars have passed as well as if a car is present over the sensor. These are battery powered devices that are put under roads and are expected to last from 5 to 10 years on battery. The more cars that go over the sensor the faster the battery will drain. The software to configure the Traffic Dots is openly given out by the manufacturer and through some clever social engineering you managed to get access. You put the software on your laptop and got the proper radio technology to use the software. You are near an intersection where the traffic is very busy in one direction but not the other. There has to be a way to increase traffic by modifying these Traffic Dots which may result in someone running a red light due to impatience
