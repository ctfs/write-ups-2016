**Points:** 100
**Solves:**
**Description:**

> Scenario:
>
> One morning before the daily IT team meeting, Joseph Adams inadvertently installs malware posing as a software update onto his corporate Windows VM. The malware beacons out to a Linux machine outside the corporate network and the waiting attacker uses Joe’s Windows 7 VM as a pivot point to reach the rest of the internal, corporate network.
>
>
> The attacker locates a Linux-based file server and uses credentials that Joe had stored in an unencrypted plaintext file to log in to the file server.
>
>
> The attacker locates a Truecrypt file on the file server, exfiltrates the file, and replaces the original file with a second file that he/she has uploaded.
>
>
> When Joe returns from his morning meeting, he notices the attacker is still connected to his VM. He immediately logs in to the hypervisor, suspends the VMs, and retains the volatile memory (raw/DD) and virtual hard disk (VMDK) files from the affected machines for forensic analysis.
>
>
> Later that afternoon, the attacker contacts the company’s CIO Office and offers up the original file and password for ransom.
>
>
> The corporate CIO would like the internal IR Team to investigate whether the exfiltrated Truecrypt file can be recovered without having to pay the ransom.
>
>
> Evidence
>
> Archive Password: fV9kilIT29ITiGrZkvrOjZ4ENEK82O5ble4F9l5imirhDZ92COp9uPEZTCjNrAY
>
> Prove that you have found the stolen file by providing its sha1sum
