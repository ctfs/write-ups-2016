We've observed that whenever the site owner needs to check out one of the
Markdown pages on his site:
  - they first clear their cookies, so you can't steal their session ID,
  - when they visit the site, they switch to the Markdown library with, uh,
    better escaping, and
  - afterwards, they visit the flag page again to make sure it hasn't been
    deleted (and also to taunt you).
