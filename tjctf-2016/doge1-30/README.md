# tjctf-2016 : doge1-30

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 30
**Description:** My friend's dog was swimming around in the ocean and found a flag, but she refuses to give it to me. Can you get it from here?

## Write-up

Upon close inspection the image contains a dog holding an object with very lightly colored text. Opening the image file in a basic image editor such as Paint.NET, Photoshop, or Gimp and adjusting the contrast, saturation, and/or hue of the image would make the flag appear as `tjctf{th3_f0x_jump3d_0v3r_m3}`
