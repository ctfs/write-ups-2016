## Writeup

Connect to the IRC channel using any client (rawsec suggests Mibbit if you don't have one). Use the `/list` command to list all IRC channels, and one exists called `#6470e394cb_flagshare`. Join the channel using the command `/join #6470e394cb_flagshare`. Finally display the channels topic using the `/topic` command, where it should display `Get your flags here! while theyâ€™re hot! IceCTF{pL3AsE_D0n7_5h4re_fL495_JUsT_doNT}`.
