**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 40
**Description:**

We found this suspicous image online and it looked like it hadd been planted there by an alien life form. Can you see if you can figure out what they're trying to tell us?

## Writeup

By Googling `alien message cipher key` and looking at images, the first result contained a dictionary of the sybmols found in the cipher image, and their English translation. Either do this by hand, or as rawsec suggests, check out [this decryption tool](http://www.gotfuturama.com/Interactive/AlienCodec/) online. The image decrypts to form the flag: `IceCTF{good_n3wz_3veryon3_1_l1k3_fu7ur4ma_4nd_th3ir_4maz1ng_3as7er_39g5}`
