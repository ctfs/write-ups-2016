# IceCTF-2016 : contract-130

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 130
**Description:**

Our contractors stole the flag! They put it on their file server and challenged us to get it back. Can you do it for us? nc contract.vuln.icec.tf 6002 server.py. We did intercept someone connecting to the server though, maybe it will help.contract.pcapng
