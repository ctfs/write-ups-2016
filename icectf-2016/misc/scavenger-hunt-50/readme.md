**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 50
**Description:**

There is a flag hidden somewhere on our website, do you think you can find it? Good luck!

## Writeup

To search for the flag manually, press Ctrl+U on each page (it's on the sponsors page) and Ctr+F search the source code for the string `IceCTF{` until you find the flag, or for a quicker method, use the Linux bash command `wget -r *.icec.tf.* | grep "IceCTF{"` to download the website and filter the results using `grep` to find this on the sponsors page: `<img class="activator" src="/static/images/logos/syndis.png" alt="IceCTF{Y0u_c4n7_533_ME_iM_h1Din9}">` which contains the flag in the alternate attribute.
