**Category:** Misc
**Points:** 40
**Description:**

There's something about this domain... search.icec.tf, I don't see anything but maybe its all about the conTEXT.

## Writeup

This challenge requires DNS lookup knowledge. DNS (Domain Name System) provides computers information about a specific domain. It is somewhat recognizable as a DNS record, as `TXT` is one of many DNS record types. Using `dig`, we can run `dig -t TXT search.icec.tf/` to search that domain for TXT records in the DNS. For the long output of the query, check out rawsec's write-up linked below, where you will see the flag is `IceCTF{flag5_all_0v3r_the_Plac3}`
