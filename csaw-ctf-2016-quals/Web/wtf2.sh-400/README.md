       Do I need to say more?

FLAG  
       You  can  get  the flag to this second part of
       the problem by getting the website to run  the
       get_flag2 command. Sadly, I can't seem to find
       anything in the code that does that :( Do  you
       think you could take a look at it for me?

ACCESS  
       You can find wtf.sh at http://web.chal.csaw.io:8001/

SUPERHERO ORIGIN STORY  
       I have deep-rooted problems
       That involve  childhood  trauma  of  too  many
       shells
       It was ksh, zsh, bash, dash
       They just never stopped
       On that day I swore I would have vengeance
       I became
       The Bashman
