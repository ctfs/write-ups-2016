# ABCTF 2016 : tgif-30

**Category:** Ppc
**Points:** 30

**Description:**

Friday is the best day of the week, and so I really want to know how many Fridays there are in this file. But, with a twist. I want to know how many Fridays there are one year later than each date.
[HINT] For example, if you got November 21, 2001, I want to know if November 21, 2002 is a Friday. Also, the answer is in the format ABCTF{}

## Write-up

Read-in every date and use python-datetime to calculate the weekday in the next year...
