# ABCTF 2016 : aes-mess-75

**Category:** Crypto
**Points:** 75

**Description:**

We encrypted a flag with AES-ECB encryption using a secret key, and got the hash: e220eb994c8fc16388dbd60a969d4953f042fc0bce25dbef573cf522636a1ba3fafa1a7c21ff824a5824c5dc4a376e75
However, we lost our plaintext flag and also lost our key and we can't seem to decrypt the hash back :(.
Luckily we encrypted a bunch of other flags with the same key. Can you recover the lost flag using this?

[HINT] There has to be some way to work backwards, right?
