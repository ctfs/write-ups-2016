# ABCTF 2016 : virtual-box2-15

**Category:** Virtual
**Points:** 15
**Solves:** 316
**Description:**

Darn, I found this flag so I put it in flag 1.doc but I can't seem to be able to see it anymore.

## Write-up

In flag 1.doc you see some newlines and an empty looking line.
Simply copy paste that to another editor and you'll see the flag...
Or give another text color;-)
