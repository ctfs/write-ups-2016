**Description:**

> HALP I GOT PWNED AND I DON'T HAVE ANY BITCOINS 
> 
> 
> 
> (WARNING: this zip is password protected with the password "infected". The exe file it has contains de-fanged malware (as does a later stage of the problem). 
> 
> 
> This should not be active as is and will not infect your machine/encrypt your files, but please be very very careful as this is based on real ransomware. It is entirely possible to solve this without the exe files, but they are included for completeness.)
