# Insomni'hack CTF 2016 : Superpollute

**Category:** Shellcode
**Author:** grimmlin
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Solves:** 6
**Description:**

> So, I built this connected, self-driving car in my garage, but I used an existing motor engine to do it. The model tag is still present in memory but I really need it to be changed. Fortunately, I left this service open in order to apply small firmware patches, so send it a shellcode to find and change the tag present somewhere in memory

> HINT1 : you might need this to develop your shellcode
>
> HINT2 : gdb inside qemu-system is _broken_ on sh4. Use qemu-sh4 with -g and use a native gdb with multitarget support.
