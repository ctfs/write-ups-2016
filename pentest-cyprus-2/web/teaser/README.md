## Write-up

The most common way to find paths on a website is to look at the `sitemap.xml` and the `robots.txt` files.  

In the `robots.txt` we find an interesting path:  

>User-agent: *
>Disallow: /admin

Entering */admin* we find a login page. Testing a few common user/pass combinations we find that it's `admin/admuin`  

There are some hidden hints in case you couldn't know this common user/pass combination  
- The admin has left a comment in the HTML to change the pass to something harder: `<!-- TODO: Change password to something harder -->`
- When clicking submit with any other username except `admin` you get a **Wrong Username** message, that means that the username is `admin`
