## Write-up

From the challenge category and the file attached extension it's very clear that we need to investigate a packet capture.  
We open the file with wireshark and start filtering!  
In most cases the http traffic holds interesting information so we filter out everything else by adding `http` as the wireshark filter, and we have something!  
`24	4.677081	192.168.0.111	216.194.172.238	HTTP	444	GET /net075/ HTTP/1.1 `
`29	4.903108	216.194.172.238	192.168.0.111	HTTP	71	HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  (text/html)`
In the above requests we have communication with this ip 216.194.172.238 (which is the 2016.pentestcyprus.org ip) and we can see that the path has to do with the challenge name *net075*  
Doing some further inspection in the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol* we see that the path uses **Basic Auth** (Authorization: Basic Og==\r\n AND WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="My Realm"\r\n).
The credentials are missing from the Authorization header so there is not much to do there. Moving deeper to the packet capture we find another request to */net075* that this time is successful,
giving us the following credentials **Credentials: ragnarLothbrok:King of the Normanns!**  
So without further ado we visit 2016.pentestcyprus.org/net075 to test it out and.. :confused: we get a message *Access to humans is strictly forbidden!*  
We get back to the packet capture to see if we missed something, and yes we did, the message wasn't random! Humans are not allowed to that page, only bots, and to be more precise the Googlebot that we can find it's User Agent in the request header from wireshark: **User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)\r\n**  
Adding the User Agent with a simple *User Agent Switcher browser extension* does the trick and unlocks the Basic Auth portal. There we place the credentials we found earlier and a congratulations message appears.
The message here appears to be broken so with a simple **ctrl+shift+c** (inspect element) we can find the hidden hash!
