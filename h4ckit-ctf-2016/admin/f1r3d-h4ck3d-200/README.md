Egypt

> One fine day the war began and all the businesses in the country were stopped. Many companies have laid off their employees and dissolved entire departments. But one of those who was fired from his job, did not like this: the last working day he hack the company, and left  the country in a hurry. Help the company to assess the damage from hacking: the archive of files from his desktop is provided to you.  h4ck1t{FLAG}
