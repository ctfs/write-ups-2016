France

> There was some photos of unknown experiment taken in a secret lab-X for they internal archive. After that the device from which the shot was made, immediately load crypto-trigger, whose function â€“ to ensure the confidentiality of image data (this is exactly how it should be in a super-secret laboratories?).

> It is known that, due to some floating code errors, the trigger has not completed his work and not all the photos was encrypted.

> We managed to get a binary, which has something to do with that crypto-trigger software.

> And now we have a good chance to find out what secrets hides laboratory-X.

> The first step I did is printing the symbol table of the shared library to figure out what functions are exported.
