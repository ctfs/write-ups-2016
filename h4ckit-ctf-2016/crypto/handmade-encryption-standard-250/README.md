I'm soldier Alderson and some time ago we got this Rijndael cipher: \xa2\xc5\xe7\xcc\xe4\xa9\xb6\x41\x0b\x77\x92\x54\x78\xdb\xed\xab\xe0\x1d\xac\x83\x2e\xe2\x6b\x43\x07\x1a\x61\xf2\x81\x0f\xfe\xc6\x6e\x36\xc5\x7b\xd6\x9c\xca\x05\x93\x76\x43\xa9\x08\x45\xa4\x8f\x88\xb9\x31\x7e\x22\x7f\x00\x00\x48\xb7\x31\x7e\x22\x7f\x00\x00
And we have even intercepted its key(!):
21449030350486006488383082093598
But the problem is that decryption operation have failed somehow =(
Our math-team found out that standart algorithm was modified by cryptographer - he decided to use his own substitution-box instead of default!
Math team also found out that modification was pretty simple - cryptographer just exchanged 3 elements of that substitution-box between them. But which ones?..Help our math-team to find this out ;)
P.S General Tompson can't talk right now.
