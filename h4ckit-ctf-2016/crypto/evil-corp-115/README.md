> Genegal Thompson welcomes you! Let me be extremely brief. Our forensic team have already been investigating "The Great Plantation" project for 2 years. During this long period we knew a lot of interesting things like: 1) This is the project of Masons. 2) The main target is to take over the world with planting own people into big companies. 3) Masons do not trust modern encryption algorithms. 4) Masons think their own alphabet will let them to communicate more securely than anything else. Short time ago we have withdrawn the notebook of one of their members. There was one interesting file named "THEPlantation.txt". Surely, it was encrypted. Help us to pull the info out of this! Yours, Gen. Tompson
