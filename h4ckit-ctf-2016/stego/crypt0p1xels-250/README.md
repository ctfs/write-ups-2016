> We have received pictures from the enemy companion of the unknown before planet. And we haven't thought up anything better, than to construct DeathStarV3 (the general was a fan of "Star Wars") and to absorb energy of the whole planet! And again we are pursued by problems: that we don't know coordinate! Your task is to determine coordinates of this unique planet (which according to our spy are ciphered in the image). Also he could steal one of the scripts intended for embedding of coordinates. All hope only for you!  h4ck1t{flag}
