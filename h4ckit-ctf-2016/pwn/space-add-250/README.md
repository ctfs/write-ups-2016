> We're in space. Our spacecraft's gun need to be properly configured. We want our gun to shoot as fast as possible and of course we don't want to overheat it. The gun's manual says that the maximum shooting rate is 31337*31337. However, this can be a little bit imprecise. Your goal is to increase the shooting rate to be the maximum allowed.
